Maven 2.0.11

  The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 2.0.11.

  Maven 2.0.11 is {{{/download.html} available for download}}.

  Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
  (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

  The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately.
  See the {{{/plugins/index.html} Plugin List}} for more information.
