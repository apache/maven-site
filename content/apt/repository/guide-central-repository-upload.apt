Guide to uploading artifacts to the Central Repository

 In order for Maven users to depend on your project, you must deploy
 the artifact, the POM, and their PGP signatures to
 a remote repository. The most common public shared repository is
 {{{/repository/}Maven Central}}.

Requirements

 [[1]] <<releases>>: Only <releases> can be uploaded to the Central Repository.
 A release can only depend on other files already released and available in the repository.
 The Central Repository will not change or replace a release after it is published.

 [[2]] <<javadoc and sources>> for IDE lookup

 [[3]] <<PGP signature>>

 [[4]] <<minimum POM information>>: There are some requirements for the minimal information in the POMs that are in the Central Repository,
 see {{{https://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html}"Why do we have Requirements"}}

 [[5]] <<coordinates>>: Picking the appropriate coordinates for your project is important. See 
 {{{https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html}the guidelines}}, particularly
 the details about group ID and domain ownership.

 []

<<{{{https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/} The updated list of requirements}}>> can be found at Sonatype.

* A basic sample:

+----+

<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven</artifactId>
  <version>2.0</version>
  <packaging>jar</packaging>

  <name>Maven core</name>
  <description>The maven main core project description</description>
  <url>https://maven.apache.org</url>

    <license>
      <name>Apache License, Version 2.0</name>
      <url>http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt</url>
      <distribution>repo</distribution>
    </license>
  </licenses>

  <scm>
    <url>https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven</url>
  </scm>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>...</groupId>
      <artifactId>...</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>

  <!--
  NOT RECOMMENDED: (see FAQ)
  <repositories></repositories>
  <pluginRepositories></pluginRepositories>
  -->
</project>

* PGP Signature

 When people download artifacts from the Central Repository, they should verify these artifacts' PGP
 signatures against a public key server.
 If there are no signatures, then users have no guarantee that they
 are downloading the original artifact.

 The Central Repository requires PGP signatures for all artifacts (all
 files except checksums) with a public key available from a key server
 like {{{https://pgp.mit.edu}https://pgp.mit.edu}}. Read
 {{{https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/}Working with PGP Signatures}}
 for more information.

* FAQ and common mistakes

 * I have other <<<repositories>>> or <<<pluginRepositories>>> listed in my POM. Is that a problem?

 At present, this won't preclude your project from being included, but we do strongly encourage making sure all your dependencies
 are included in the Central Repository. If you rely on sketchy repositories that have junk in them or disappear, it creates havok for
 downstream users. Try to keep your dependencies among reliable repos like Central, JBoss, etc.

 * What about artifacts that can't be distributed because of their license?
 
 In that case only the POM for that dependency is required, listing where the dependency can be downloaded from.
 {{{https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/javax/activation/activation/1.0.2/activation-1.0.2.pom}See an example}}.

 * I have a patched version of the foo project developed at foo.com, what <<<groupId>>> should I use?

 When you modify a third party project, that patched version becomes your project and therefore should
 be only be publicly distributed under a <<<groupId>>> you control, never under <<<com.foo>>>.
 (If you're only distributing to a private repository inside your organization, do whatevcer's convenient.)
 When changing the group ID, you should also change the
 Java package to avoid classpath conflicts and split package issues. See
 {{{https://jlbp.dev/JLBP-6}JLBP 6}}.


 * My project is hosted at a project hosting service like SourceForge or Github. What should I use as groupId?

 If your project name is <<<foo>>> at SourceForge, you can use <<<net.sf.foo>>>.
 If your username is <<<bar>>> on Github, you can use <<<com.github.bar>>>.
 You can also use another reversed domain name you control. The group ID does
 not have to reflect the project host.

Publishing your artifacts to the Central Repository

* Approved Repository Hosting

 We encourage projects to use an approved repository hosting location.

 Currently approved repository hosting locations:

  * {{{https://repository.apache.org/}Apache Software Foundation}} (for all Apache projects)

 []

* Other Projects

 The easiest way to upload another project is to use the
 {{{https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/}Open Source Software Repository Hosting (OSSRH)}},
 which is an approved repository provided
 by Sonatype for <any> OSS Project that wants to get its artifacts into the Central Repository.
