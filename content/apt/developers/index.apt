Maven Developer Centre

  This documentation centre is for people who work on the source code of
  Maven itself and its core plugins, or who would like to contribute.
  If you simply use Maven to build your own projects, it won't be
  very helpful.

  If you cannot find your answers here, feel free to ask the {{{mailto:dev@maven.apache.org}Maven Developer List}}.
