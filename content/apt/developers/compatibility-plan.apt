Maven Plugins Compatibility Plan

* Scope

  This page describes the system requirements plan, which consists of:

  [[1]] minimum <<Java>> runtime prerequisite for Maven plugins, which can be extended to shared components,

  [[2]] minimum <<Maven>> runtime prerequisite for plugins.

  []

  Such requirements are displayed as "System Requirements" in every plugin info report (see {{{/plugins/maven-clean-plugin/plugin-info.html}this example}}).

  Consolidated view for all LATEST plugins release is visible in a {{{https://ci-maven.apache.org/job/Maven/job/maven-box/job/maven-dist-tool/job/master/site/dist-tool-prerequisites.html}daily generated report}}.

* Maven Plan

  * Until 2012, Maven 2.2.1 + Java 5 prerequisites, with plugins versions in 2.x

  * Since 2012, Maven 3.0 + Java 7 prerequisites, with plugins in 3.x.y

  * Since June 2020, Maven Plugin API used by plugins >= 3.1.0 + Java 8 prerequisites {{{https://s.apache.org/MVN-PLUGIN-MIGRATION-3.1}Technical details}}

  * In March 2023, Maven before 3.2.5 has been {{{/docs/history.html#maven-3-6-x-and-before}marked as EOL}}, meaning that plugins should use 3.2.5 as minimum

  * In April 2023, Maven before 3.6.3 has been {{{/docs/history.html#maven-3-6-x-and-before}marked as EOL}}, meaning that plugins should use 3.6.3 as minimum

  * In February 2024, Maven 4 after 4.0.0-alpha-12 will require Java 17 (as per {{{https://lists.apache.org/thread/bfkvvjftrxypp06yj8zj919fcz0dt2zt}vote on the Mailing List}}).
