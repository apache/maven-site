Releasing A Parent POM

  Releasing a Parent POM is much the same as any other Maven project. The following
  guide walks through most of the steps:

    * {{{./maven-project-release-procedure.html} Maven Project Common Release procedure}}
  
  Note that Parent POMs have particular conventions for managing and deploying the documentation.

* Rationale

  To be able to publish a documentation for the parent POM without affecting released <<<pom.xml>>> and <<<site.xml>>>,
  parent POM projects have a specific module, with the documentations <<<docs>>>.

* Stage the release

  Then the only difference is with commands to stage the site:

  In Maven Apache Parent POM:

--------
cd target/checkout
mvn -f docs site
mvn -f docs scm-publish:publish-scm
--------

  In Maven Projects Parent POM:

--------
cd target/checkout
mvn -f docs site site:stage
mvn -f docs scm-publish:publish-scm
--------

* Call the vote

  In the vote, additional to  providing links to JIRA, the parent POMs should include a link to the Git changes since the
  last release:
