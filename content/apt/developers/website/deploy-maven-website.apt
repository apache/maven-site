Introduction

 This document gives step-by-step instructions for deploying the main Maven {{{/}https://maven.apache.org}} website.

 <<Require updates>> this documentation requires some updates: with the migration of site source to Git, Apache CMS is not used any more.
 It is replaced by Git edit (eventually through GitHub with the "edit" link accessible from breadcrumb) followed
 by Jenkins job to build and commit to svnpubsub. This does not really change the overall picture, but detailed instructions on editing are obsolete.

 See {{{./index.html}Maven website introduction}} for instructions on the whole website publication.


Overview

 Since December 2012, the overall website uses svnpubsub mechanism and the main website uses Apache CMS:

[main-website.png] Main website mechanisms overview


How main website publication works

 Maven main website ({{https://maven.apache.org}}) is generated with {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin}maven-site-plugin}} from a source tree
 stored in svn: {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk}}.


* Edit source content

 You can edit source content in 2 ways:

   [[1]] use {{{https://cms.apache.org/maven/}the CMS UI}} through your web browser: 

     * Go to {{https://cms.apache.org/maven/}}.

     * Click link "Get Maven Working Copy".

     * Navigate to the content you want to modify.

     * Once you have modified the content, commit with the button "Submit".

     []

   [[2]] checkout the source content locally, modify it with your favorite text editor, eventually test the result (<<<mvn site>>>), then check-in source modifications.

   []

 After source tree is modified in svn, {{{http://ci.apache.org/builders/maven-site-staging}a Buildbot job}} is triggered: 

   [[1]] it builds the HTML site using {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin}maven-site-plugin}}: <<<mvn site>>>,

   [[2]] it publishes generated HTML content to {{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/staging/maven/trunk/content/}CMS staging svn area}},

   [[3]] svnpubsub mecanism transfers svn CMS staging content to live CMS staging site: {{http://maven.staging.apache.org}},

   []


* Publish site content

 If everything is good, <<publish modifications>> using {{{https://cms.apache.org/maven/publish}CMS publish}} action.

 Under the hood:

   [[1]] CMS copies CMS staging svn area content to {{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven/content/}website production svn area}},

   [[2]] svnpubsub mecanism transfers svn production content to live production site: {{http://maven.apache.org}}.

 []


How Doxia website publication works

 Doxia uses the exact same mecanisms:

 * you can edit {{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/site/trunk}svn source tree}} either locally or
 through {{{https://cms.apache.org/maven-doxia/}CMS UI}},

 * {{{http://ci.apache.org/builders/maven-doxia-site-staging}a Buildbot job}} builds the site and updates 
 {{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/staging/maven-doxia/trunk/content/}website staging svn area}},

 * svnpubsub published to {{{http://maven-doxia.staging.apache.org}live staging site}},

 * if everything is good, <<publish modifications>> using {{{https://cms.apache.org/maven-doxia/publish}CMS publish}} action,

 * CMS copies CMS staging svn area content to {{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven-doxia/content/}website production svn area}},

 * svnpubsub mecanism transfers svn production content to live production site: {{http://maven.apache.org/doxia}},
 with its {{{/doxia/extpaths.txt}<<<extpaths.txt>>>}}
