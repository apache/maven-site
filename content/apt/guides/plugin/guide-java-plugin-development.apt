Introduction

  This guide is intended to assist users in developing Java plugins for
  Maven.

* Important Notice: {Plugin Naming Convention and Apache Maven Trademark}

  You will typically name your plugin <<<<yourplugin>-maven-plugin>>>.

  Calling it <<<maven-<yourplugin>-plugin>>> (note "Maven" is at the beginning 
  of the plugin name) is <<strongly discouraged>> since it's a 
  <<reserved naming pattern for official Apache Maven plugins maintained by the Apache Maven team>> 
  with groupId <<<org.apache.maven.plugins>>>.
  Using this naming pattern is an infringement of the Apache Maven Trademark.

* Your First Plugin

  In this section we will build a simple plugin which takes no parameters
  and simply displays a message on the screen when run.  Along the way, we
  will cover the basics of setting up a project to create a plugin, the
  minimal contents of a Java mojo, and a couple ways to execute the mojo.

** Your First Mojo

  At its simplest, a Java mojo consists simply of a single class.  There is
  no requirement for multiple classes like EJBs, although a plugin which
  contains a number of similar mojos is likely to use an abstract
  superclass for the mojos to consolidate code common to all mojos.

  When processing the source tree to find mojos, {{{/plugin-tools/} <<<plugin-tools>>>}}
  looks for classes with either <<<@Mojo>>> Java 5 annotation or "<<<goal>>>" javadoc annotation.
  Any class with this annotation are included in the plugin configuration file.

*** A Simple Mojo

  Listed below is a simple mojo class which has no parameters.  This is
  about as simple as a mojo can be.  After the listing is a description
  of the various parts of the source.

+---+
package sample.plugin;

import org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo;
import org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException;
import org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Mojo;

/**
 * Says "Hi" to the user.
 *
 */
@Mojo( name = "sayhi")
public class GreetingMojo extends AbstractMojo
{
    public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        getLog().info( "Hello, world." );
    }
}
+---+

  * The class <<<org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo>>> provides most of the
    infrastructure required to implement a mojo except for the
    <<<execute>>> method.

  * The annotation "<<<@Mojo>>>" is required and control how and
    when the mojo is executed.

  * The <<<execute>>> method can throw two exceptions:

    * <<<org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException>>> if an unexpected
      problem occurs.  Throwing this exception causes a "BUILD ERROR" message
      to be displayed.

    * <<<org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoFailureException>>> if an expected
      problem (such as a compilation failure) occurs.  Throwing this exception
      causes a "BUILD FAILURE" message to be displayed.

    []

  * The <<<getLog>>> method (defined in <<<AbstractMojo>>>) returns a
    log4j-like logger object which allows plugins to create messages at levels
    of "debug", "info", "warn", and "error".  This logger is the accepted means
    to display information to the user. Please have a look at the section
    {{{../../plugin-developers/common-bugs.html#Retrieving_the_Mojo_Logger}Retrieving the Mojo Logger}} for a hint on
    its proper usage.

  []

 All Mojo annotations are described by the {{{../../developers/mojo-api-specification.html#The_Descriptor_and_Annotations}Mojo API Specification}}.

** Project Definition

  Once the mojos have been written for the plugin, it is time to
  build the plugin.  To do this properly, the project's descriptor
  needs to have a number of settings set properly:

*------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|<<<groupId>>>     |This is the group ID for the plugin, and should match the |
|                  |common prefix to the packages used by the mojos           |
*------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|<<<artifactId>>>  |This is the name of the plugin                            |
*------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|<<<version>>>     |This is the version of the plugin                         |
*------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|<<<packaging>>>   |This should be set to "<<<maven-plugin>>>"                |
*------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|<<<dependencies>>>|A dependency must be declared to the Maven Plugin Tools   |
|                  |API to resolve "<<<AbstractMojo>>>" and related classes   |
*------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

  Listed below is an illustration of the sample mojo project's pom with the parameters set as described in the above table:

+----+
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>sample.plugin</groupId>
  <artifactId>hello-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <packaging>maven-plugin</packaging>

  <name>Sample Parameter-less Maven Plugin</name>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-plugin-api</artifactId>
      <version>3.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- dependencies to annotations -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugin-tools</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-plugin-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>3.4</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
+----+

** Build Goals

  There are few goals which are defined with the <<<maven-plugin>>>
  packaging as part of a standard build lifecycle:

*-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|<<<compile>>>|Compiles the Java code for the plugin and builds the|
|             |plugin descriptor                                   |
*-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|<<<test>>>   |Runs the plugin's unit tests                        |
*-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|<<<package>>>|Builds the plugin jar                               |
*-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|<<<install>>>|Installs the plugin jar in the local repository     |
*-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|<<<deploy>>> |Deploys the plugin jar to the remote repository     |
*-------------+----------------------------------------------------+

** Executing Your First Mojo

  The most direct means of executing your new plugin is to specify the
  plugin goal directly on the command line.  To do this, you need to
  configure the <<<hello-maven-plugin>>> plugin in you project:

+----+
...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>sample.plugin</groupId>
        <artifactId>hello-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
...
+----+

  And, you need to specify a fully-qualified goal in the form of:

+----+
mvn groupId:artifactId:version:goal
+----+

  For example, to run the simple mojo in the sample plugin, you would enter
  "<<<mvn sample.plugin:hello-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:sayhi>>>" on the
  command line.

  <<Tips>>: <<<version>>> is not required to run a standalone goal.

*** Shortening the Command Line

  There are several ways to reduce the amount of required typing:

  * If you need to run the latest version of a plugin installed in your local
  repository, you can omit its version number. So just use
  "<<<mvn sample.plugin:hello-maven-plugin:sayhi>>>" to run your plugin.

  * You can assign a shortened prefix to your plugin, such as <<<mvn hello:sayhi>>>.
    This is done automatically if you follow the convention of using
    <<<$\{prefix\}-maven-plugin>>> (or <<<maven-$\{prefix\}-plugin>>> if the plugin is
    part of the Apache Maven project). You may also assign one through additional
    configuration - for more information see
    {{{../introduction/introduction-to-plugin-prefix-mapping.html} Introduction to Plugin Prefix Mapping}}.

  * Finally, you can also add your plugin's groupId to the list of groupIds
  searched by default.  To do this, you need to add the following to
  your <<<$\{user.home\}/.m2/settings.xml>>> file:

+----+
<pluginGroups>
  <pluginGroup>sample.plugin</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>
+----+

  []

  At this point, you can run the mojo with "<<<mvn hello:sayhi>>>".


*** Attaching the Mojo to the Build Lifecycle

  You can also configure your plugin to attach specific goals to a particular
  phase of the build lifecycle.  Here is an example:

+-----+
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>sample.plugin</groupId>
        <artifactId>hello-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>sayhi</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+-----+

  This causes the simple mojo to be executed whenever Java code is compiled.
  For more information on binding a mojo to phases in the lifecycle, please
  refer to the {{{../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html}Build Lifecycle}} document.

* Mojo archetype

  To create a new plugin project, you could using the Mojo
  {{{../introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html}archetype}} with the following command line:

+---+
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DgroupId=sample.plugin \
  -DartifactId=hello-maven-plugin \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-plugin
+---+

* {Parameters}

  It is unlikely that a mojo will be very useful without parameters.
  Parameters provide a few very important functions:

  * It provides hooks to allow the user to adjust the operation of the
    plugin to suit their needs.

  * It provides a means to easily extract the value of elements from
    the POM without the need to navigate the objects.

  []

** Defining Parameters Within a Mojo

  Defining a parameter is as simple as creating an instance variable
  in the mojo and adding the proper annotations.  Listed below is an
  example of a parameter for the simple mojo:

+-----+
    /**
     * The greeting to display.
     */
    @Parameter( property = "sayhi.greeting", defaultValue = "Hello World!" )
    private String greeting;
+-----+

  The portion before the annotations is the description of the
  parameter.  The <<<parameter>>> annotation identifies
  the variable as a mojo parameter.  The <<<defaultValue>>>
  parameter of the annotation defines the default value for the variable.  This value can
  include expressions which reference the project, such as
  "<<<$\{project.version\}>>>" (more can be found in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/PluginParameterExpressionEvaluator.html}"Parameter Expressions" document}}). The <<<property>>> parameter can be used to allow configuration
  of the mojo parameter from the command line by referencing a system property that the user sets
  via the <<<-D>>> option.

** Configuring Parameters in a Project

  Configuring the parameter values for a plugin is done in a Maven
  project within the <<<pom.xml>>> file as part of defining the
  plugin in the project.  An example of configuring a plugin:

+-----+
<plugin>
  <groupId>sample.plugin</groupId>
  <artifactId>hello-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <configuration>
    <greeting>Welcome</greeting>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
+-----+

  In the configuration section, the element name
  ("<<<greeting>>>") is the parameter name and the contents of
  the element ("<<<Welcome>>>") is the value to be assigned to
  the parameter.

  <<Note>>: More details can be found in the
  {{{../mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html}Guide to Configuring Plugins}}.

** Parameter Types With One Value

  Listed below are the various types of simple variables which can be used as
  parameters in your mojos, along with any rules on how the values in the
  POM are interpreted.

*** Boolean

  This includes variables typed <<<boolean>>> and <<<Boolean>>>.  When reading
  the configuration, the text "<<<true>>>" causes the parameter to be set to
  true and all other text causes the parameter to be set to false. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My boolean.
     */
    @Parameter
    private boolean myBoolean;
+-----+

+-----+
<myBoolean>true</myBoolean>
+-----+

*** Fixed-Point Numbers

  This includes variables typed <<<byte>>>, <<<Byte>>>, <<<int>>>,
  <<<Integer>>>, <<<long>>>, <<<Long>>>, <<<short>>>, and <<<Short>>>.  When
  reading the configuration, the text in the XML file is converted to an
  integer value using either <<<Integer.parseInt()>>> or the <<<valueOf()>>>
  method of the appropriate class.  This means that the strings must be valid
  decimal integer values, consisting only of the digits 0 to 9 with an optional
  <<<->>> in front for a negative value. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My Integer.
     */
    @Parameter
    private Integer myInteger;
+-----+

+-----+
<myInteger>10</myInteger>
+-----+

*** Floating-Point Numbers

  This includes variables typed <<<double>>>, <<<Double>>>, <<<float>>>, and
  <<<Float>>>.  When reading the configuration, the text in the XML file is
  converted to binary form using the <<<valueOf()>>> method for the appropriate
  class.  This means that the strings can take on any format specified in
  section 3.10.2 of the Java Language Specification.  Some samples of valid
  values are <<<1.0>>> and <<<6.02E+23>>>.

+-----+
    /**
     * My Double.
     */
    @Parameter
    private Double myDouble;
+-----+

+-----+
<myDouble>1.0</myDouble>
+-----+

*** Dates

  This includes variables typed <<<Date>>>.  When reading the configuration,
  the text in the XML file is converted using one of the following date
  formats: "<<<yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.S a>>>" (a sample date is "2005-10-06
  2:22:55.1 PM") or "<<<yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssa>>>" (a sample date is "2005-10-06
  2:22:55PM").  Note that parsing is done using <<<DateFormat.parse()>>> which
  allows some leniency in formatting.  If the method can parse a date and time
  out of what is specified it will do so even if it doesn't exactly match the
  patterns above. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My Date.
     */
    @Parameter
    private Date myDate;
+-----+

+-----+
<myDate>2005-10-06 2:22:55.1 PM</myDate>
+-----+

*** Files and Directories

  This includes variables typed <<<File>>>.  When reading the configuration,
  the text in the XML file is used as the path to the desired file or
  directory.  If the path is relative (does not start with <<</>>> or a drive
  letter like <<<C:>>>), the path is relative to the directory containing
  the POM. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My File.
     */
    @Parameter
    private File myFile;
+-----+

+-----+
<myFile>c:\temp</myFile>
+-----+

*** URLs

  This includes variables typed <<<URL>>>.  When reading the configuration, the
  text in the XML file is used as the URL.  The format must follow the RFC 2396
  guidelines, and looks like any web browser URL
  (<<<scheme://host:port/path/to/file>>>).  No restrictions are placed on the
  content of any of the parts of the URL while converting the URL.

+-----+
    /**
     * My URL.
     */
    @Parameter
    private URL myURL;
+-----+

+-----+
<myURL>http://maven.apache.org</myURL>
+-----+

*** Plain Text

  This includes variables typed <<<char>>>, <<<Character>>>, <<<StringBuffer>>>,
  and <<<String>>>.  When reading the configuration, the text in the XML file is
  used as the value to be assigned to the parameter.  For <<<char>>> and
  <<<Character>>> parameters, only the first character of the text is used.

*** Enums

  Enumeration type parameters can also be used. First you need to define
  your enumeration type and afterwards you can use the enumeration type
  in the parameter definition:

+-----+
    public enum Color {
      GREEN,
      RED,
      BLUE
    }

    /**
     * My Enum
     */
    @Parameter
    private Color myColor;
+-----+

  So lets have a look like you can use such enumeration in your pom configuration:

+-----+
<myColor>GREEN</myColor>
+-----+

  You can also use elements from the enumeration type as defaultValues like the
  following:

+-----+
    public enum Color {
      GREEN,
      RED,
      BLUE
    }

    /**
     * My Enum
     */
    @Parameter(defaultValue = "GREEN")
    private Color myColor;
+-----+


** Parameter Types With Multiple Values

  Listed below are the various types of composite objects which can be used as
  parameters in your mojos, along with any rules on how the values in the
  POM are interpreted.  In general, the class of the object created to hold the
  parameter value (as well as the class for each element within the parameter
  value) is determined as follows (the first step which yields a valid class
  is used):

  [[1]] If the XML element contains an <<<implementation>>> hint attribute, that is used

  [[2]] If the XML tag contains a <<<.>>>, try that as a fully qualified class name

  [[3]] Try the XML tag (with capitalized first letter) as a class in the same package as the mojo/object being
        configured

  [[4]] For arrays, use the component type of the array (for example, use <<<String>>>
        for a <<<String[]>>> parameter); for collections and maps, use the
        class specified in the mojo configuration for the collection or map;
        use <<<String>>> for entries in a collection and values in a map

  []

  Once the type for the element is defined, the text in the XML file is
  converted to the appropriate type of object


*** Arrays

  Array type parameters are configured by specifying the parameter multiple
  times. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My Array.
     */
    @Parameter
    private String[] myArray;
+-----+

+-----+
<myArray>
  <param>value1</param>
  <param>value2</param>
</myArray>
+-----+

*** Collections

  This category covers any class which implements <<<java.util.Collection>>>
  such as <<<ArrayList>>> or <<<HashSet>>>.  These parameters are configured by
  specifying the parameter multiple times just like an array. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My List.
     */
    @Parameter
    private List myList;
+-----+

+-----+
<myList>
  <param>value1</param>
  <param>value2</param>
</myList>
+-----+

  For details on the mapping of the individual collection elements, see
  {{{../mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html#Mapping_Lists}Mapping Lists}}.

*** Maps

  This category covers any class which implements <<<java.util.Map>>>
  such as <<<HashMap>>> but does <<not>> implement <<<java.util.Properties>>>.
  These parameters are configured by including XML tags in the form
  <<< <key>value</key> >>> in the parameter configuration. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My Map.
     */
    @Parameter
    private Map myMap;
+-----+

+-----+
<myMap>
  <key1>value1</key1>
  <key2>value2</key2>
</myMap>
+-----+

*** Properties

  This category covers any map which implements <<<java.util.Properties>>>.
  These parameters are configured by including XML tags in the form
  <<< <property><name>myName</name> <value>myValue</value> </property> >>>
  in the parameter configuration. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My Properties.
     */
    @Parameter
    private Properties myProperties;
+-----+

+-----+
<myProperties>
  <property>
    <name>propertyName1</name>
    <value>propertyValue1</value>
  <property>
  <property>
    <name>propertyName2</name>
    <value>propertyValue2</value>
  <property>
</myProperties>
+-----+

*** Other Object Classes

  This category covers any class which does not implement <<<java.util.Map>>>,
  <<<java.util.Collection>>>, or <<<java.util.Dictionary>>>. Example:

+-----+
    /**
     * My Object.
     */
    @Parameter
    private MyObject myObject;
+-----+

+-----+
<myObject>
  <myField>test</myField>
</myObject>
+-----+

  Please see {{{../mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html#Mapping_Complex_Objects}Mapping Complex Objects}} for details
  on the strategy used to configure those kind of parameters.

* Using Setters

 You are not restricted to using private field mapping which is good if you are trying to make you Mojos resuable
 outside the context of Maven. Using the example above we could name our private fields using the underscore
 convention and provide setters that the configuration mapping mechanism can use. So our Mojo would look
 like the following:

+----+

public class MyQueryMojo
    extends AbstractMojo
{
    @Parameter(property="url")
    private String _url;

    @Parameter(property="timeout")
    private int _timeout;

    @Parameter(property="options")
    private String[] _options;

    public void setUrl( String url )
    {
        _url = url;
    }

    public void setTimeout( int timeout )
    {
        _timeout = timeout;
    }

    public void setOptions( String[] options )
    {
        _options = options;
    }

    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        ...
    }
}

+----+

 Note the specification of the property name for each parameter which tells Maven what setter and getter to use when
 the field's name does not match the intended name of the parameter in the plugin configuration.
