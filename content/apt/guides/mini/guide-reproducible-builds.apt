Configuring for Reproducible Builds

* What are Reproducible Builds?

 {{{https://reproducible-builds.org/}Reproducible builds}} are a set of software development practices that create an
 independently-verifiable path from source to binary code. A build is <<reproducible>> if given the same source code,
 build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate <<bit-by-bit>> identical copies of all specified artifacts.

 {{{https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central}Reproducible Central}} lists projects releases that
 have been checked as reproducible by rebuilding independently from the reference build published in Central Repository.

* How do I configure my Maven build?

 There is no Maven version prerequisite. Everything happens at plugin level:

 [[1]] Upgrade your plugins to reproducible versions: to easily detect {{{/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/plugin-issues.html}required upgrades}}, run
 
--------
mvn artifact:check-buildplan
--------

 [[2]] Enable Reproducible Builds mode for plugins, by adding {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74682318#Reproducible/VerifiableBuilds-OutputArchiveEntriesTimestamp}<<<project.build.outputTimestamp>>> property}} to the project's <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--------+
   <properties>
     <project.build.outputTimestamp>2023-01-01T00:00:00Z</project.build.outputTimestamp>
   </properties>
+--------+

 []

 Notice: starting with Maven 4.0.0-beta-5, Reproducible Builds mode will be active by default (see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8258}MNG-8258}}), without modifying project's <<<pom.xml>>>.
 Setting a value in your <<<pom.xml>>> will only be useful if you want to override the inherited value.

 You have the basics configured. The output should be mostly reproducible now.
 
* How to test my Maven build reproducibility?

 Using {{{/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/compare-mojo.html}<<<maven-artifact-plugin>>>'s <<<compare>>> goal}},
 you can easily check that the second build of your project produce the same output than an initial build:

 [[1]] build and <<<install>>> your project (don't hesitate to customize arguments to better match your project):
 
--------
mvn clean install 
--------

 [[2]] rebuild (<<<verify>>> only, without installing) and check against the previous install:
 
--------
mvn clean verify artifact:compare
--------

 []

 Notice that this local test does NOT really prove that your build is yet reproducible by a third party, because it may still suffer from environment leaks (username, current directory, ...). But it is easy to do, and prevents basic non-reproducible issues like timestamps.
 Really checking reproducibility requires to rebuild from a completely different setup: this is harder to do, even if containers may ease the task.

** Staging

 If the first build is done with `deploy` to a private remote repository, the rebuild and its verification can be done by someone else referencing the staging location, like for example at Apache during votes on staged releases candidates:

--------
mvn verify artifact:compare -Dreference.repo=https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/staging/
--------

* How to fix my Maven build reproducibility?

 If something is still not reproducible after initial setup and {{{/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/plugin-issues.html}automatic check from <<<artifact:check-buildplan>>>}}:
 
 [[1]] Use {{{https://diffoscope.org/}diffoscope}} to find the unstable output between builds. The <<<artifact:buildinfo>>> goal proposes a command with path to files: just copy/paste to launch.
  
 [[2]] Find the plugin that generated this output.

 [[3]] Check if a reproducible version of the plugin is available.
 If not, please open an issue to help plugin maintainers improving Reproducible Builds support at every plugin level.

* More Details

 Reproducible Builds for Maven:
 
 * Require <<no version ranges>> in dependencies,

 * Generally give <<different results on Windows and Unix>> because of different newlines. (carriage return linefeed on Windows, linefeed on Unixes)

 * Generally depend on the <<major version of the JDK>> used to compile. (Even with source/target defined, each major JDK version changes the generated bytecode)

 []

 For detailed explanations, see {{{https://s.apache.org/reproducible-builds}Maven "Reproducible/Verifiable Builds" Wiki page}}.

* FAQ

 * Q. Can the <<<project.build.outputTimestamp>>> property in <<<pom.xml>>> be updated automatically at release time?

   A. Yes.
   
   Details depend on your release process tooling:

   * if you use {{{/plugins/maven-release-plugin/}maven-release-plugin}}, you'll need <<version 3.0.0-M1 or later>>:
     it will automatically update the timestamp value in <<<pom.xml>>> during the release in the same commit that updates version,

   * if you have a custom release process tooling, you'll need to add the feature to your release tooling.
     Notice that if you're using <<<versions-maven-plugin>>> in custom release scripts, starting with release 2.9.0, {{{https://github.com/mojohaus/versions-maven-plugin/issues/453}<<<versions:set>>> goal updates the property}}.

   * instead of explicitly writing a timestamp in their <<<pom.xml>>>, some people tend to prefer using last Git commit timestamp, like <<<$\{git.commit.time}>>> from
   {{{https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin}git-commit-id-maven-plugin}} (with <<<\<dateFormatTimeZone>UTC</dateFormatTimeZone\>>>> to be independent from user's timezone).

 * Q. Which additional plugins need to be updated for Reproducible Builds?
 
   A. See the list of {{{/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/plugin-issues.html}required upgrades}}
