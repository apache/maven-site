Guide to Selecting Alternative Wagon Providers

  By default, Maven uses the <<<java.net.URLConnection>>> (<<<HttpURLConnection>>>) classes provided with the JDK to 
  access repositories that use the HTTP/HTTPs protocols. Unfortunately, since this implementation contains
  certain bugs, Maven users may find themselves unable to connect to servers that demand some configurations.
  A couple examples of weird behavior include line-wrapping the Authorization header's Base64 value when passwords
  are long, and using cached values in preemptive authentication for successive connections to the same server.
  
  Maven 2.2.0 attempted to amend this problem by switching over to a Wagon implementation that's based on 
  Apache HttpClient. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent that HttpClient doesn't support NTLM (at least, 
  version 2), which effectively means users behind NTLMv2 proxies cannot use Maven 2.2.0.
  
  To hopefully resolve this once and for all, Maven 2.2.1 will contain support for specifying which Wagon
  provider you want to use for a given protocol during the build. The provider name will then be appended
  to the protocol using the format <<<\<protocol\>-\<provider\>>>> to form the component role-hint for the Wagon.
  
  As of Maven 2.2.1, there are two ways to specify which Wagon provider should be used: via the command line,
  or in the <<<\<server\>>>> configuration section of the <<<settings.xml>>>.
  
*Command-Line Configuration

  To specify the Wagon provider from the command line, simply use the 
  <<<-Dmaven.wagon.provider.\<protocol\>=\<provider-name\>>>> command-line option, like the following:
  
+---+
mvn -Dmaven.wagon.provider.http=httpclient clean install
+---+

  This instructs Maven to use the HttpClient-based Wagon implementation for connections to HTTP repositories.

*<<<settings.xml>>> Configuration

  To specify which Wagon provider to use for a particular server, modify your <<<settings.xml>>> file to add
  the <<<\<wagonProvider\>>>> configuration to your <<<\<server\>>>> entry, like the following:
  
+---+
<settings>
  [...]
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>central</id>
      <configuration>
        <wagonProvider>httpclient</wagonProvider>
        [...]
      </configuration>
    </server>
+---+

*Available Wagon Providers

  Maven 2.2.1 provides two providers for HTTP/HTTPS Wagons: <<<lightweight>>> and <<<httpclient>>>.
  If you add a new HTTP Wagon implementation via build extension, you'll need to make sure the
  extension binds its Wagon components to role-hints of the form <<<\<protocol\>-\<provider\>>>>
  in order to allow users to specify your alternative Wagon provider. For instance, the HttpClient
  HTTP Wagon component definition looks like this:
  
+---+
<component>
  <role>org.apache.maven.wagon.Wagon</role>
  <role-hint>http-httpclient</role-hint>
  <implementation>org.apache.maven.wagon.providers.http.HttpWagon</implementation>
  <instantiation-strategy>per-lookup</instantiation-strategy>
</component>
+---+

  <<NOTE:>> The default provider for HTTP/HTTPS Wagons is <<<lightweight>>>.
