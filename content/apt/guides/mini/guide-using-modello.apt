Guide to using Modello

 {{{https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/modello/}Modello}} is a tool for generating resources from a simple model. From a
 {{{https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/modello/modello.html}simple model}} you can generate things like:

 * Java sources

 * XML serialization code for the model

 * XML deserialization code for model

 * Model documentation

 * XSD

 []

 A typical modello model looks like the following:

%{snippet|id=modello-model|url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/maven-archetype/master/archetype-models/archetype-descriptor/src/main/mdo/archetype-descriptor.mdo}

 To utilize Modello, you would configure the <<<modello-maven-plugin>>> something like the following where you want
 to generate the Java sources for the model, the xpp3 serialization code and the xpp3 deserialization code
 (see {{{https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/modello/modello-plugins/modello-plugin-xpp3/}modello-plugin-xpp3}} for more details):
