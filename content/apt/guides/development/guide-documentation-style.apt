Guide To Maven Documentation Style

* Where did the style came from?

  The documentation style guide was created to make our documentation more
  consistent and also to apply best practices to the documentation as well.
  The standard has just been started and will expand over time based on the
  suggestions made on the Maven dev mailing list. It is a community consensus
  of how we should write our documentation.

  Each rule in this guide should come with a motivation as to why it exists.
  References to external sources are encouraged.

* Date format

  How people format a date varies around the world, sometimes making it hard
  for people to understand each other. The solution to this problem comes in
  the form of the ISO-8601 standard.

  A date in our documentation must follow this standard:

  <<YYYY-MM-DD>>

  where <<YYYY>> is the year in the Gregorian calendar, <<MM>> is the month of
  the year between 01 (January) and 12 (December), and <<DD>> is the day of the
  month between 01 and 31.

 <<Note>>: All documentation meta-data should respect this convention, for instance for this given APT document:

~~ NOTE: Add more rules here. Follow the heading style of the rule above.

* POM Snippet

  A POM file must use 2 spaces for each indentation. Because POM snippets are
  often used in documentation to show the user how to configure something, it is
  important that these snippets aren't too wide. If they are too wide, 
  the page is difficult to read on a smaller screen.

  When you use a snippet of XML from the POM as an example in
  documentation, make sure that the example is properly indented.
  A user should be able to copy and paste the example into their own POM without
  changing the indentation.

  Also, you should declare all parent POM elements to improve the comprehension. You could use ellipsis (i.e. ...) if
  you don't want to specify elements.

** Example

  The following is an example of how the distribution management of the Maven
  site is configured.

+-----+
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0">
  ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <site>
      <id>apache.website</id>
      <url>scp://people.apache.org/www/maven.apache.org/</url>
    </site>
  </distributionManagement>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  As you can see above the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> element is indented
  once (=2 spaces), the <<<\<site\>>>> element is indented twice (=4 spaces), and
  the <<<\<id\>>>> is indented three times (=6 spaces).

* Naming Documentation Files

 All file names should replace space by a hyphen (-), for instance for this given APT document:

-------
 guide-documentation-style.apt
-------

* Updating Documentation Files

 A good practice is to update the date (with the correct date format) when you are updating documentation files.

* Write Thinking

 Here are some pointers about English rules when typing material:
