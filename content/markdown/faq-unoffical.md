### How do I merge a list of configuration items in a parent POM with those in a child POM?

Since plugin configurations are handled as XML DOM instances by the core, there is an ever-present struggle between when
to merge child elements' values with one another (when the child's `<source>` overrides the parent's, for example), and
when you want to append new child elements to the existing list (as in the example above, or any time you have a list of
items to aggregate during inheritance).

We've solved this problem using an attribute, `combine.children`. You simply specify this attribute, with the value of
`append` at the parent element where such aggregation should occur, and Maven will switch its merge behavior for that
element's children.

NOTE: I fixed this behavior in Maven's trunk; previously, it had been putting the parent POM's sub-elements AFTER those
of the child. This is inconsistent with other inheritance functions, so I've reversed the ordering to truly append the
child's elements.

So, to recap:

parent:

```
<configuration>
  <items>
      <item>one</item>
      <item>two</item>
  </items>
</configuration>
```

child:

```
<configuration>
  <items combine.children="append">
    <item>three</item>
  </items>
</configuration>
```

result:

```
<configuration>
  <items>
    <item>one</item>
    <item>two</item>
    <item>three</item>
  </items>
</configuration>
```

(If you're using an earlier version of Maven than trunk (revId 545315), the order above will be three, one, two.)

### Why do I not get an index.html page generated for my project website?

The usual cause of this is configuring maven-project-info-reports plugin and leaving out the 'index' report.

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-project-info-reports-plugin</artifactId>
  <reportSets>
     <reportSet>
        <reports>
           <report>index</report>                <--------- here!
           <report>dependencies</report>
           <report>cim</report>
           <report>scm-list</report>
           <report>issue-tracking</report>
        </reports>
     </reportSet>
  </reportSets>
</plugin>
```

### How do I resolve the "< plugin name > does not exist or no valid version" error?

This error indicates that Maven is either unable to access the required plug-in from your local repository, or unable to
access the official or `central` Maven plug-in repository.

To resolve this error:

- If you are behind a http proxy, check the
  [proxy settings guide](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html).
- If you are upgrading Maven from an older version, try running with \-U. This will force an update check on all
  plug-ins.

If the error persists, browse [archived discussions](http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/), post to the
Maven user list, or log a [ticket](https://github.com/apache/maven/issues) describing your problem, if you think it is a
bug. Tickets may also be issued for feature enhancement requests, and other tasks.

### How do I include/exclude the other modules in the navigation menu in the parent site?

MNG-661 provides a simple patch which provides parent and module links using
the project URLs which as you correctly point out only work when the site is deployed.

### How do I install a file in my local repository along with a generic POM?

You may do this by typing this command (please take note that this is a single line only).

```
mvn install:install-file
      -DgroupId=<group-id>
      -DartifactId=<artifact-id>
      -Dversion=<version>
      -Dfile=<path-to-file>
      -Dpackaging=<packaging> (i.e. jar)
      -DgeneratePom=true
```

This command installs the jar in your local repository with the generated generic pom.
{{Well, this doesn't work in Maven 2.0.2. It just gives the message "Cannot execute mojo: install-file. It requires a
project with an existing pom.xml, but the build is not using one." \--kreiger@imcode.com}}

### How do I install a file in my local repository along with my customized POM?

The solution requires the `-DpomFile=<path-to-pom>` parameter just like the sample below.

```
mvn install:install-file
      -DgroupId=<group-id>
      -DartifactId=<artifact-id>
      -Dversion=<version>
      -Dfile=<path-to-file>
      -Dpackaging=<packaging> (i.e. jar)
      -DpomFile=<path-to-pom>
```

This command will install the file in your local repository along with your customed pom.

_Plugins & Lifecycle_

## General

### How do I get a plugin's dependencies from a Mojo?

```
public class MyMojo
    extends AbstractMojo
{
    /**
     * @parameter expression="${plugin.artifacts}"
     * @required
     */
    private List pluginArtifacts;

    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        ...
        for ( Iterator i = pluginArtifacts.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
        {
            Artifact pluginArtifact = (Artifact) i.next();
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

### How do I get the project's sources from a Mojo?

```java
public class MyMojo
  extends AbstractMojo {
  /**
   * @parameter expression="${project.compileSourceRoots}"
   * @required
   */
  private List sourceRoots;

  public void execute()
    throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    for (Iterator i = sourceRoots.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
      String sourceRoot = (String) i.next();

      // Do what you want with these directories
    }
  }
}
```

### Does the v4.0.0 POM include a < versions/ > element?

The POM does not include a `<versions/>` element. The POM reflects the current state of a project's build only, not a
historical build log. The POM is not designed to track historical information, as it would be difficult for developers
to always add this information manually, i.e., to always remember to add it or to ensure that the correct information is
added when multiple branches are involved.

However, if the SCM tag of the `<scm>` section of the POM is populated, the repository records build versions, enabling
developers to reconstruct the information for each released build.

_POM, General_

### How do I create a report that does not require Doxia's Sink interface?

Make it a report and override the `isExternalReport()` method to return true.

_Sites & Reporting_

### How do I prevent verification warnings with custom repositories?

Warnings from custom repositories (usually located within the organization's network, or even on the same workstation)
are triggered when Maven tries to verify the integrity of the files in the repository. This verification is done via the
SHA1 or MD5 sum of the file. If these sum files do not exist, then a warning appears.

Support for downloading the security sum files is not yet included in the Maven2 distribution. There are free
command-line utilities on the Internet that generate these sums. Below is an example of a bash script (
use [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) if you are using a windows machine) that generates sha1sum for all jar, xml and pom
files contained in the directory where it is executed:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/bash

gensum(){
   shaname=$1.sha1

   sum=`sha1sum $1 ]( cut -f1 -d" "`
   echo $sum > $shaname
}

processFile(){
   while read oneline
   do
      gensum $oneline


   done < "$1"
}

tmpFile=$TMP/shagen.list

echo "Generating sha1 sums for XML files"
find . -name "*.xml" > "$tmpFile"

processFile "$tmpFile"

echo "Generating sha1 sums for POM files"
find . -name "*.pom" > "$tmpFile"

processFile "$tmpFile"

echo "Generating sha1 sums for JAR files"
find . -name "*.jar" > "$tmpFile"

processFile "$tmpFile"

rm "$tmpFile"
```

The script above has been tested on [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) and is provided "as-is" and with no guarantee.
_Errors, Repositories_

### What does the "ERROR: Cannot override read-only parameter:

`<parameter_name>` " message, when running <plugin_name>: mean?

This means that the parameter being overriden in the pom.xml is read-only. Hence, it is not possible to override this
parameter.

_Errors, POM_

### How do I generate Maven plug-in sites, with pages that include an overview of the goals and parameters for each plug-in?

Include maven-plugin-plugin as a report.

_Plugin Requests, Sites & Reporting_

### Can I define the antrun plugin to be executed on demand like "mvn antrun:run"?

The antrun plugin can be executed on demand only if:

- the top level configuration of the plugin contains all the information
- a variable is passed from the command line, eg `-Dtarget=foo antrun:run`
- the appropriate target in the script is executed based on the variable

However, it is recommended that developers write plugins for their goals (Ant support for
plugins will be available soon, currently you must write them in java or beanshell).

_Plugins and Lifecycle, Ant-related_

### How do I properly populate variables, when extending a mojo from another plugin?

When creating plugins, the field metadata is read from source files, so it is not available when the original source is
not available. While the metadata is available in the plugin in `META-INF/maven/plugin.xml`, currently, there is no way
to incorporate it when building a new plugin.

It is currently recommended that plug-ins be built using composition, instead of inheritence.

_Plugin Requests, Design, Patterns & Best Practices_

### How do I specify my remote repo in Maven?

To specify a remote repo in Maven, add the `<repositories>` element to the POM:

```xml

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>my-repo2</id>
    <name>your custom repo</name>
    <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Or, refer to the following page [https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html)

### How do I specify which output directories the Eclipse plugin puts into the .classpath file?

```xml

<build>
  <!-- ... -->
  <pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <outputDirectory>target-eclipse</outputDirectory>

_General, Plugins and Lifecycle_

### Can a profile inherit the configuration of a "sibling" profile?

No. Profiles merge when their ID's match - so you can inherit them from a parent POM (but you can't inherit profiles
from the same POM).

### How do I run an ant task twice, against two different phases?

You can specify multiple execution elements under the executions tag, giving each a different id and binding them at
different phases.

```xml

<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>one</id>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
      <configuration>
        <tasks>
          <echo message="generate-sources!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"/>
        </tasks>
      </configuration>
      <goals>
        <goal>run</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>

    <execution>
      <id>two</id>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <configuration>
        <tasks>
          <echo message="package!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"/>
        </tasks>
      </configuration>
      <goals>
        <goal>run</goal>

  <version>2.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <systemProperties>

### How do I integrate static (x)html into my Maven site?

You can integrate your static pages in this several steps,

* Put your static pages in the resources directory, `$\{basedir\}/src/site/resources`.
* Create your site.xml and put it in `$\{basedir\}/src/site`. An example below:

```xml

<project name="Maven War Plugin">
  <bannerLeft>
    <name>Maven War Plugin</name>
    <src>https://maven.apache.org/images/apache-maven-project.png</src>
    <href>https://maven.apache.org/</href>
  </bannerLeft>
  <bannerRight>
    <src>https://maven.apache.org/images/maven-small.gif</src>
  </bannerRight>
  <body>
    <links>
      <item name="Maven" xhref="https://maven.apache.org/"/>
    </links>

    <menu name="Overview">
      <item name="Introduction" xhref="introduction.html"/>
      <item name="How to Use" xhref="howto.html"/>
    </menu>
    ${reports}
  </body>
</project>
```

* Link the static pages by modifying the `<menu>` section, create items and map it with the filename of the static
  pages.

```xml

<menu name="Overview">
  <item name="Introduction" xhref="introduction.html"/>
  <item name="How to Use" xhref="howto.html"/>
  <item name="<put-name-here>" xhref="<filename-of-the-static-page>"/>
</menu>
```

### How do I specify that all web modules will inherit the group's common files from a parent web module?

maven-war-plugin 2.0-beta-3 and later supports merging of wars. Just reference the common WAR project from another WAR
project as a dependency of `<type>war</type>` and it will automatically be merged.

### How do I determine the stale resources in a Mojo to avoid reprocessing them?

This can be done using the following piece of code:

```
// Imports needed

import org.codehaus.plexus.compiler.util.scan.InclusionScanException;
import org.codehaus.plexus.compiler.util.scan.StaleSourceScanner;
import org.codehaus.plexus.compiler.util.scan.mapping.SuffixMapping;

// At some point of your code
StaleSourceScanner scanner = new StaleSourceScanner(0, Collections.singleton("**/*.xml"), Collections.EMPTY_SET);
scanner.addSourceMapping( new SuffixMapping(".xml", ".html") );
Set<File> staleFiles = (Set<File>) scanner.getIncludedSources(this.sourceDirectory, this.targetDirectory);
```

The second parameter to the StaleSourceScanner is the set of includes, while the third parameter is the set of excludes.
You must add a source mapping to the scanner (second line). In this case we're telling the scanner what is the extension
of the result file (.html) for each source file extension (.xml). Finally, we get the stale files as a `Set<File>`
calling the `getIncludedSources` method, passing as parameters the source and target directories (of type File). The
Maven API doesn't support generics, but you may cast it that way if you're using them.
In order to use this API you must include the following dependency in your pom:

```xml

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.plexus</groupId>
    <artifactId>plexus-compiler-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.1</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

_Plugins and Lifecycle, Sites & Reporting, Errors_

### Where do I configure report plug-ins, like javadoc?

Generally, you should configure reporting in the `<reporting>` (vs. `<build>`) section of the POM. Configuration there
applies to both the site, and when run on the command line, and adding the plugin there adds the report to the generated
site.

Configuration in the build section is only used during the normal lifecycle or the command line invocation (eg
`javadoc:javadoc`).

Configuration should go there if you do not want the report on the site, or the configuration differs from what is on
the site (eg, some plugins have a fail build option).

Then run `mvn deploy`.
_Deployment_

### How do I add main class in a generated jar's manifest?

Configure the maven-jar-plugin and add your main class.

```

    </archive>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### How do I install artifacts to a remote repository?

You need at least 2.1-SNAPSHOT version of maven-deploy-plugin to make this work, current workaround to use this is to
copy the wagon provider jar (i.e. wagon-ftp-1.0-alpha-3.jar) in your `%M2_HOME%/lib` and execute the command:

```
mvn deploy:deploy-file
    -DgroupId=<groupId>
    -DartifactId=<artifactId>
    -Dversion=<version>
    -Dpackaging=<packaging>

### Does a POM inherit its resources?

Yes, resources are inherited, but only if the child pom does not define any resources. If it does, then the project just

### How do I run a process without waiting for reports or unit tests?

To run a build/package/deploy process without waiting for reports or unit tests, e.g. in order to quickly deploy to an
integration box, you could create a specific profile that skips the reporting and test phases.

Also refer to [How do I skip unit tests when building a project?](#How_do_I_skip_unit_tests_when_building_a_project.3F)

### How do I execute the assembly plugin with different configurations?

Add this to your pom,

        </execution>

        <execution>
          <id>2</id>
          <phase>install</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>assembly</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <descriptor>src/main/descriptors/src.xml</descriptor>
            <finalName>${project.build.finalName}-src</finalName>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
  <!--...-->

</build>

and run `mvn install`, this will execute the assembly plugin twice with different config.

### What is Maven's order of inheritance?

_General, Inheritance and Interpolation, Design, Patterns & Best Practices_

### How do I add my generated sources to the compile path of Maven, when using Modello?

Modello generate the sources in the generate-sources phase and automatically adds the source directory for compilation
in maven. So you don't have to copy the generated sources.

You have to declare the modello-plugin in the build of your plugin for source generation (in that way the sources are
generated each time).

### What does the "You cannot have two plugin executions with the same (or missing) `<id/>` elements" message mean?

It means that you have executed a plugin multiple times with the same `<id>`. Provide each `<execution>` with a unique

### Can I disable transitive dependencies?

No you can't, but you may exclude the dependencies you dont want to include in your project.

    <groupId><!-- group id --></groupId>
    <artifactId><!-- artifact id --></artifactId>
    <version><!-- version --></version>
    <scope><!-- scope --></scope>
    <exclusions>
      <exclusion>
        <groupId><!-- groupId-of-the-artifact --></groupId>

### How do I create a command line parameter (i.e., \-Dname=value ) in my mojo?

In your mojo, put `expression=$\{<exp>\}` in your parameter field

```java
/**
 * @parameter expression="${expression.name}"
 */
private String exp;
```

You may now able to pass parameter values to the command line.
`mvn \-Dexpression.name=value install`

_Command Line_

### What is the purpose of displaying read-only, plug-in fields in user documentation, if they are not configurable in the project descriptor?

Often, parameters are specified as read-only to indicate that its value should be changed indirectly, rather than in the
plugins `<configuration/>` section. For instance, I may have a plugin that declares a parameter as such:

```java
/**
 * @parameter default-value="${project.build.directory}"
 * @required
 * @readonly
 */
private File buildDir;
```

In this case, my plugin wants to output something to the project's build directory. If this were configured directly on
the plugin, it might not be cleaned up when the user issued `mvn clean`, so instead I mark it as `@readonly`. This
tells the user that she should modify the structure referenced by *default-value*(i.e. `<project><build><directory/>` in
the POM) instead, which will allow this plugin to be a good citizen in the build process.

### I've just created a maven plugin. Is there a sample plugin integration test I can use?

Each integration test is a separate project. For a plugin, you may want to create a project that will use your plugin
and probably put it inside src/test/projects like maven-antrun-plugin, maven-eclipse-plugin, maven-javadoc-plugin and
several others. 

_Plugins and Lifecycle, Sites & Reporting, Integration tests_

### The snapshot version of the plugin is not updated in the snapshot repo, What should I do to update my copy of the plugin?

If the plugin in the snapshot repo is not yet updated, the only way to
update it is to check out the source and build it.

### Is there a way to get Maven to report the number of compile errors found?

Currently, this type of summary information is not built into the compiler plugin, but it would be possible to add.

_Sites & Reporting_

### In a multi-module project, is there any way for Maven to build only those modules that have changed from the previous build and leave the unchanged modules alone (i.e. not build them)?

Currently, this is not possible. The main reason is that it's non-trivial to determine whether an entire project's build
is stale (the project here being one of the modules). It will be dependent on the phase being called, and the packaging
of the particular module.

### Where is the plugin-registry.xml?

From the settings.xml, you may enable it by setting `<usePluginRegistry/>` to true and the file will be in
`~/.m2/plugin-registry.xml`

_General, Plugins and Lifecycle_

### Is there a way to specify a different output directory without having to edit the pom or configuration file each time I do a build?

Yes. You can make use of the POM's `<properties>` element to accomplish this.

To do so, simply add the following fragment to your pom:

```xml

<project>
  <!--...-->
  <build>
    <directory>${directory}</directory>
    <outputDirectory>${directory}/classes</outputDirectory>
    <testOutputDirectory>${directory}/test-classes</testOutputDirectory>
  </build>
  <properties>
    <directory>target</directory>     <!-- will serve as the default -->
  </properties>
  <!--...-->
</project>
```

Now, to specify a different output directory at runtime simply use the directory property as a mvn command line
parameter: `mvn -Ddirectory=tmp`.

This will send the build's output files to the `$\{basedir}/tmp` directory.

Now, to specify a different output directory at runtime simply use the directory property as a mvn command line
parameter;
`mvn -Ddirectory=tmp package`

This will send the build's output files to the `$\{project.basedir}/tmp` directory.

_POM, Command Line_

### How do I compile 1.3 java sources with a 1.4.x or 1.5.x JDK?

You need to specify the `<compilerVersion>` element to 1.3, i.e.

```xml

<project>
  <!--...-->
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <verbose>true</verbose>
          <fork>true</fork>
          <executable><!-- path-to-javac --></executable>
          <compilerVersion>1.3</compilerVersion>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  <!--...-->
</project>
```

### How do I change the default remote repository?

Define in your POM a repository with "central" as the repository id.

```xml

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>central</id>
    <name>any name</name>
    <url>http://your.remote.repo.url.org</url>
    <!--...-->
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

_Repositories_

### I have my web.xml in my customized directory layout for my webapp, but why am I getting the error

`"Deployment descriptor <Path>\WEB-INF\web.xml does not exist"`?

You may specify the path of your web.xml in your webapp by configuring maven-war-plugin.

```xml

<build>
  <!--...-->
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <webXml><!-- path-to-your-webxml --></webXml>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

_Errors, Deployment_&nbsp;

### Is it possible to specify multiple `<module>`(s) in a POM at a greater depth than 1 level?

Yes. This can be done in two ways: 1. add the extra path in the top level POM, or 2. add extra parent poms at different
levels, if appropriate.

For example, you have the following structure:

```
/A/pom.xml (multi-module POM)
/A/B/C/pom.xml
/A/B/C/D/pom.xml
```

And you want the modules at level C and D built when the multi-module POM is built.

For the first solution:
Add the following at the top level POM:

```xml

<modules>
  <module>A/B</module>
  <!-- ... -->
</modules>
```

For the second solution:
Add the following at the top level POM:

```xml

<modules>
  <module>B</module>
</modules>
```

And in directory A/B/, add an extra parent POM and add the following:

```xml

<modules>
  <module>C</module>
</modules>
```

Both ways are effectively the same, but if you have that inheritance structure, the second gives a more natural
grouping (eg, you can `cd` into "B" and build all its subprojects only).
If you do the first solution, the children poms should have the following hint in the parent element:

```xml

<parent>
  <!--...-->
  <artifactId>A</artifactId>
  <relativePath>../../pom.xml</relativePath>
</parent>
```

The repository is still used if `../../pom.xml` is not found or the versions don't match, but the hint makes it easier
to
use local modifications without installing the parent.

_POM_

### How to list all goals available for a certain plugin?

We can use the describe goal of maven-projecthelp-plugin to list the goals available, see sample syntax below.

`mvn projecthelp:describe -Dplugin=org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-eclipse-plugin -Dfull=true`

This would display all the goals and descriptions of the parameters used by maven-eclipse-plugin.
To get a quick overview about available mojos you can use the 'help' mojo which automatically gets generated in newer
plugins.

```
mvn [pluginname]:help
e.g. mvn eclipse:help
```

_Plugins and Lifecycle, IDEs_

### What does aggregator mean in mojo?

When a Mojo has a `@aggregator` expression, it means that It can only build the parent project of your
multi-module-project, the one who has the packaging of pom. It can also give you values for the expression `$
\{reactorProjects\}` where reactorProjects are the MavenProject references to the parent pom modules.

### Why there are no dependency properties in Maven?

They were removed because they aren't reliable in a transitive environment. It implies that the dependency knows
something about the environment of the dependee, which is back to front. In most cases, granted, the value for war
bundle will be the same for a particular dependency - but that relies on the dependency specifying it.

In the end, we give control to the actual POM doing the building, trying to use sensible defaults that minimise what
needs to be specified, and allowing the use of artifact filters in the configuration of plugins.

### How do I prevent including JARs in `WEB-INF/lib`? I need a "compile only" scope

The scope you should use for this is provided. This indicates to Maven that the dependency will be provided at run time
by its container or the JDK, for example.

Dependencies with this scope will not be passed on transitively, nor will they be bundled in a package such as a WAR,
or included in the runtime classpath.

### How do I list available plugins?

The "Available Plugins" page lists them, and provides additional information to browse the Maven repository.
See [https://maven.apache.org/plugins]

### How do I determine what version of a plugin I am using?

You can use the Maven Help Plugin's describe goal. For example, to find out the version of the install plugin:
`mvn -Dplugin=install help:describe`.
Note that you must give the plugin prefix as the argument to plugin, not it's artifact ID.

### How can I use Ant tasks in Maven?

There are currently 2 alternatives:

* For use in a plugin written in Java, Beanshell, or other Java-like scripting language, you can construct the Ant
  tasks [using the instructions given in the Ant documentation](http://ant.apache.org/manual/antexternal.html)
* If you have very small amounts of Ant script specific to your project, you can use
  the [AntRun plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin/index.html).

### Is it possible to create my own directory structure?

Absolutely yes!

By configuring `<sourceDirectory>`, `<resources>` and other elements of the `<build>` section.

In addition, you may need to change the plugin configuration if you are not using plugin defaults for their
files/directories.

### Why does Maven compile my test classes but doesn't run them?

Tests are run by the surefire plugin.
The surefire plugin can be configured to run certain test classes and you may have unintentionally done so by specifying
a value to `${test}`.
Check your settings.xml and pom.xml for a property named "test" which would like this:

```xml
<!-- ... -->
<properties>
  <property>
    <name>test</name>
    <value>some-value</value>
  </property>
</properties>
  <!-- ... -->
```

or

```xml
<!-- ... -->
<properties>
  <test>some-value</test>
</properties>
  <!-- ... -->
```

### Where are the Maven XSD schemas?

The Maven XSD is located here and the Maven Settings XSD is located here.
Your favorite IDE probably supports XSD schema's for pom.xml and settings.xml editing. You need to specify the
following:

```xml

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <!-- ... -->
</project>
```

```xml

<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <!-- ... -->
</settings>
```

### Maven doesn't work, how do I get help?

We have compiled a list of available resources on
the [getting help page](https://maven.apache.org/users/getting-help.html)

(#Dependencies, Design, Patterns & Best Practices)

### Where to find the source code for org.apache.maven.model package?

The source for the model package is generated by modello. From your maven-model source, build it, and you should able to
see tha java files inside /target/generated-sources directory.

### List of available Maven mirrors.

Here is the list of available mirrors you can use, just use one of the following mirror entries in your settings.xml

```xml

<settings>

  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>dotsrc.org</id>
      <url>http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/maven2</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
    <mirror>
      <id>ggi-project.org</id>
      <url>http://ftp.ggi-project.org/pub/packages/maven2</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
    <mirror>
      <id>sunsite.dk</id>
      <url>http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/maven2</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
    <mirror>
      <id>planetmirror.com</id>
      <url>http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/maven2</url>

      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>

</settings>
```

### Unsupported Protocol Error when deploying a 3rd party jar. What should I do?

When using deploy-deploy-file goal and encountered this error

> Error deploying artifact: Unsupported Protocol: 'ftp': Cannot find wagon which supports the requested protocol: ftp

You only have to place the appropriate wagon provider to your `%M2_HOME%/lib`
In this case the provider needed is ftp, so we have to place the wagon-ftp jar to the lib of your m2 installation.

If the error description is something like

> Error deploying artifact: Unsupported Protocol: 'ftp': Cannot find wagon which supports the requested protocol: ftp
> org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTP"

Place also the commons-net jar to `%M2_HOME%/lib`.

### How can I have a child project not inherit a goal (like install) from the parent?

Use the `inherited` property. Set it to `false` in the plugin configuration. So for example, if you want your parent
project to be installed but not your child, configure the install-plugin like this:

```xml

<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-install-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <inherited>false</inherited>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### How can I reference windows or unix environment variables in my POM?

Starting in maven *2.0.1*, you can reference windows and unix environment variables inside your pom.xml or settings.xml
using an expression of the form: `$\{env.VARNAME\}`
So, if you wanted to reference your home directory environment variable, you might use: `$\{env.HOME\}`

### How do I know which phase a plug-in is associated with?

Open the plugin's Mojo class source code and look for `@phase`.
This tells which phase the plugin is associated.

### Where to get sun.jdk-tools-jar-1.4.0 on MacOSX?

There is no tools.jar on a mac. The classes are included in the normal java runtime
( `/System/Library/Frameworks/ JavaVM.framework/Classes/classes.jar`).
Refer to this link [http://lists.apple.com/archives/java-dev/2002/Jun/msg00901.html] )

You only have to modify the `<systemPath>` pointing to your `classes.jar` on MacOSX.

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>sun.jdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>tools</artifactId>
  <version>1.5.0</version>
  <systemPath>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/ 1.5/Classes/classes.jar</systemPath>
  <scope>system</scope>
</dependency>
```

### How do I include tools.jar in my dependencies?

The following code includes tools.jar on Sun JDKs (it is already included in the runtime for Mac OS X and some free
JDKs).

```xml
<!-- ... -->
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>default-tools.jar</id>
    <activation>
      <property>
        <name>java.vendor</name>
        <value>Sun Microsystems Inc.</value>
      </property>
    </activation>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.sun</groupId>
        <artifactId>tools</artifactId>
        <version>1.4.2</version>
        <scope>system</scope>
        <systemPath>${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar</systemPath>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </profile>
</profiles>
  <!-- ... -->
```

### How to remove the artifact in the local repository?

As of now, there is no tool for it. You have to manually delete them in your local repository. However,
there is already some discussion about this.

### How to make a war artifact as a dependency?

When specifying a war as dependency, make sure that you have set the `<type>` to war.

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId><!-- groupId of the war --></groupId>
  <artifactId><!-- artifactId of the war --></artifactId>
  <version><!-- version of the war --></version>
  <type>war</type>
</dependency>
```

### How can I change the default location of the generated jar when I command "mvn package"?

By default, the location of the generated jar is in `$\{project.build.directory\}` or in your target directory.
We can change this by configuring the outputDirectory of maven-jar-plugin.

```xml

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/<!-- directory --></outputDirectory>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### How can I disable the timestamp appended in my deployed artifact?

When your deployed artifact is appended by timestamps it means that the artifact version is still in SNAPSHOT,
meaning it is still in the state of development. There are some ways the append process of the timestamp,

1. Change the version of your artifact.
   For example, From 1.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.0

2. Use the maven-release-plugin to prepare and create the official RELEASE version of your project artifact.
   Please see the [release guide](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-releasing.html]) for more reference.

### How to run a java program from Maven?

You may use the [exec-maven-plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/) for this.

### How can I make the war plugin produces an exploded war instead of .war file?

You may use `war:exploded` goal for this.

### Is there any variable to determine what version of an artifact was deployed after the deploy step runs?

Use `$project.artifact.resolvedVersion`.

### How do I get the top line of a table to be "headers" for that column in APT?

With the snapshot you can do:

```
](]( header 1 ](]( header 2 ](]( header 3 ](](
```

Example:

```
*----------------+----------------*--------------------------+
](]( header 1 ](](   ]( ](]( header 2 ](]( ]( ](]( header 2 ](](
*----------------+----------------*--------------------------+
cell1            ]( cell1          ](  cell3
*----------------+----------------*--------------------------+
```

### What is the suggested way to download a remote file?

Wagon is really for repository interaction, though it could be used for this.

To get the wagon:

```java
/* @component roleHint="http" */
Wagon wagon;
```

### How do I set the base directory for creating the packages created by assembly?

The assembly plugin, by default, saves the packages to your `project.build.directory` directory from your pom or

```xml

<project>
  <!-- ... -->
  <build>
    <directory>path-here</directory>
    <!-- ... -->
  </build>
  <!-- ... -->
</project>
```

Also, you can have assembly plugin use a different directory by setting the plugin parameter `outputDirectory` to your
desired directory.
More info can be found on
the [assembly plugin's website](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/introduction.html).

### How do I filter which classes should be put inside the packaged jar?

All compiled classes are always put into the packaged jar. However, you can configure the compiler plugin to exclude
compiling some of the java sources using the compiler parameter `excludes` as follows:

```xml

<project>
  <!-- ... -->
  <build>
    <!-- ... -->
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/NotNeeded*.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    <!-- ... -->
  </build>
</project>
```

### How do I install the package generated by the assembly plugin to be installed in the local repository?

Use the assembly plugin goal {{assembly:attach}} to install the generated package into the local repository.
See [Guide to Testing Development Plugins](https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-testing-development-plugins.html)
for more info on how to use it.

### Is it possible to use HashMap as configurable parameter in a plugin? How do I configure that in pom.xml?

Yes. It's possible to use a HashMap field as a parameter in your plugin. To use it, your pom configuration should look
like this:

```xml

<myMap>
  <yourkey>yourvalue</yourkey>
  <!-- ... -->
</myMap>
```

### How do I setup the classpath of my antrun plugin to use the classpath from maven?

The maven classpaths are available as ant references when running your ant script. The ant reference names and some
examples can be found here: [maven-antrun-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin/classpaths.html)

### Is there a way to read and examine the contents of a pom.xml file from inside an application?

Yes. You can use the `org/apache/maven/model/io/xpp3/MavenXpp3Reader` class from maven model to read a pom.

### Which plugins have StarTeam (SCM) support? How do they differ?

maven-scm-plugin and maven-release-plugin support via maven-scm's API and maven-scm-provider-starteam. Release plugin is
used to cut a new release of your project (label, build, assembly, deploy, etc.). SCM plugin, on the other hand, is for
scm tasks.

### Is there a way to use the deploy phase to perform some tasks without maven trying to install the artifact to a maven repository?

If you run `mvn deploy`, the 'maven-deploy-plugin' kicks in. There's no flag that tells it not to upload the file. So
you'd have to make a new lifecycle mapping/packaging for each `<type>` of artifact in your project. There's no way to "
delete" mojo's from the default lifecycle. What you could do is specify the remote repo as `[file:///tmp]` or something.
Usually people want to "upload" a war to the tomcat webapps dir, also known as deploying. That kind of deploying is not
something m2 has a phase for.

What you can do is create a profile in the pom (or super pom), and add a task/mojo to the `install` phase. For instance,
you can have the antrun plugin copy the artifact to the tomcat directory (its location specified in settings.xml). The
profile is named "dev", so whenever you want to deploy a war, you just type `mvn install -Pdev`. Don't bind to the
`deploy` phase, but to the `install` or `package` phase.

### Repository precedence

The repositories are searched through based in the order they are defined in your pom. The inherited repositories are
always searched last.
Note: You don't have to define the central repo (i.e. ibiblio).

### Is it possible to exclude a package from the generated jar file?

You can configure maven-compiler-plugin to exclude your unwanted packages or files to be compiled in the first place.
But you will not be able to prevent javac to compile those files if they are referenced by other packages within the
source tree. To prevent that, you will need to use antrun plugin ( or write your own custom plugin), bind it to compile
phase, and remove unwanted classes in `$\{project.build.directory\}/classes`. If possible, just move those
packages/files
to another source tree to become another project.

### How should I point a path for Maven to use a certain version of JDK when I have different versions of JDK installed on my PC and my JAVA_HOME already set?

If you don't want to change your system JAVA_HOME, set it in maven script instead.

### Why does release prepare goal requires the project to be released be a snapshot? Is it possible to do a release prepare from a parent project? What about from a subproject?

The `release:prepare` requires the project to be released be a snapshot because it follows the maven development process
where:

- during development, everyone works on snapshots
- at release time, the snapshot got changed to release version, checked back into SCM, labelled and then built.
- the version is then incremented with snapshot and checked into SCM again.

It is possible to do a `release:prepare` from a parent project, but both the parent project and its subproject must be
in
snapshot states.

When performing `release:prepare` in a subproject, the parent cannot be in snapshot state. The key here is that we want
to be able to reproduce the build with a label. Any snapshot state from parent or dependencies will prevent that from
happening.

### How can I create an archetype with resources mapped to the class files directory?

Specify the resources to be sources as shown below:

```xml

<sources>
  <source>src/main/resources/sampleXml.xml</source>
  <source>src/main/resources/sampleProperties.properties</source>
</sources>
```

### How do I add a description to the welcome page of the generated site when I execute mvn site?

Fill up the `<description>` in the pom.xml as shown below:

```xml

<project>
  <!--...-->
  <description>put your description here</description>
  <!--...-->
</project>
```

### What does `(f)` and `(s)` debug output mean?

`(f)` is for field injection while `(s)` is for setter injection.

### Is there a preferred way to communicate dependencies in documentation?

Same format used in Maven error reporting: `groupId:artifactId:version`
This should be easy to understand by Maven users.

### Are there any recommendations on how to handle dependencies, which aren't always required?

Create a profile and include the dependency within it.
Related document: [Class profile](https://maven.apache.org/maven-model/maven.html#class_profile).

### How to resolve problems with jtaxxx.jar?

Refer to the guide ["Coping with sun-jars"](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-coping-with-sun-jars.html)

One trick is to use apache gerinomo jars instead of installing everything manually.

### How not to include all jar files from parent pom?

Use the right scope. If you don't want them to be included, specify the scope of your dependency as provided.

### How to make Continuum work in service mode when an Error 1067 is reported?

When using WinXP, Continuum works in command line but not in service mode and reports an "Error 1067". This is due to
the system path including spaces (e.g. "c:Program Files"). To fix this remove the `%PATH%` references in `wrapper.conf`.

### Which part in pom.xml the javadoc plugin should be configured?

It can be done in the plugins section of the pom or in the plugins section of the report section in the pom.

Generally, you should configure it in the reporting section. Configuration there applies to both the site, and when run
on the command line, and adding the plugin there adds the report to the generated site.

Configuration in the build section is only used during the normal lifecycle or the command line invocation (e.g.
`javadoc:javadoc`). Configuration should go there if you do not want the report on the site, or the configuration
differs
from what is on the site (e.g., some plugins have a fail build option).

### What would it take for the MOJO one to get out of the sandbox?

A full release, with active developers.

### Using xdoclet, how come

`<fileset dir="src/main"><include name="\**/beans/*\*/*Bean.java"/></fileset>` does not work?

For an example, let's say you have a Java source at `src/main/java/com/junk/JunkBean.java`.
For it to compile correctly, it needs to have a `package com.junk;` in it.
When XDoclet walks the source starting at `src/main`, it finds a source file that identifies itself as being in package
`com.junk` but it finds the source in package `java.com.junk`.
Since the two don't match, XDoclet assumes that there is a serious problem with the source file and ignores it.

### How do I indicate array types in a MOJO configuration?

```xml

<tags>
  <tag>value1</tag>
  <tag>value2</tag>
</tags>
```

### I don't have a domain name and I don't want use my employer's domain name. What should I name my plugin package?

How will the plugin be licensed? Is it intended to just be a binary distribution or will the source be available? Where
will be the documentation be? How will people find out about it?
I think your choice is probably influenced by these questions. One option, of course, is to propose it to
www.mojohaus.org if you want to and can share the code.

### How do I access downloaded sources in eclipse?

I issued `mvn -Declipse.downloadSources=true eclipse eclipse` goal.
It created `.classpath` and `.project` for both modules, and in my local repository it downloaded sources.
How do I access them in eclipse?

```xml

<build>
  <pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <downloadSources>true</downloadSources>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </pluginManagement>
</build>
```

Make sure the generated `.classpath` actually contains sourcepath attributes, like this:

```xml

<classpathentry kind="var"
  path="M2_REPO/javax/servlet/servlet-api/ 2.4/servlet-api-2.4.jar"
  sourcepath="M2_REPO/javax/servlet/servlet- api/2.4/servlet-api-2.4-sources.jar"/>
```

### Is there a setting for testing, where I can add a directory to the classpath, which will allow the tests to access the files?

```xml

<testResources>
  <testResource>
    <targetPath>org/apache/struts/resources</targetPath>
    <directory>conf/java</directory>
    <includes>
      <include>**/*.xml</include>
      <include>**/*.dtd</include>
    </includes>
  </testResource>
  <testResource>
    <directory>src/test</directory>
    <includes>
      <include>**/*.xml</include>
    </includes>
  </testResource>
</testResources>
```

### How can I stop this the "This artifact has been relocated to" warning?

How can I stop the
`WARNING While downloading artifactId-artifactId-version This artifact has been relocated to groupId-artifactId-version`?

It's probably because some other dependency has specified the dependency on `artifactId:artifactId`. It will only go
away
when that declaration is fixed in that POM.

### I would like clarification on what version of the JDK is required for m2 - particularly with respect to creating Plugins.

1.4 is required to run m2 there are problems when using 1.5 features in plugins. People tried and failed because qdox (
used for some mojo stuff doesn't support new 1.5 language)

### I'm wondering what a "snapshot" actually is.

A snapshot is a development version. e.g, 2.0-SNAPSHOT is the "still-in-development future 2.0".If you want to use a
snapshot, just use `<version>` , e.g. `<version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>` . But first you must ensure that you have access
to the repository containing this version.

### Is it possible that if I do `mvn eclipse:eclipse` goal, my project would get disconnected from the SVN repository?

1.4 is required to run m2 there are problems when using 1.5 features in plugins. People tried and failed because qdox (
used for some mojo stuff doesn't support new 1.5 language)

### Does it matter if the project's directory name is not the same as the artifactId?

It does not really matter. It'll work, some defaults might have to be overridden (e.g. SCM inheritance, though that's
hopefully going to change), and the parent path if not.

### pom.xml or settings.xml? What is the best practice configuration usage for these files?

The best practice guideline between settings.xml and pom.xml is that configurations in settings.xml must be specific to
the current user and that pom.xml configurations are specific to the project.

For example, `<repositories>` in pom.xml would tell all users of the project to use the `<repositories>` specified in
the pom.xml. However, some users may prefer to use a mirror instead, so they'll put `<mirrors>` in their settings.xml so
they can choose a faster repository server.

so there you go:

```
settings.xml > user scope
pom.xml > project scope
```

### What is reactorProjects? executedProject?

`$\{reactorProjects}` are the projects that the current mvn command are going to be built. This will include the parent
project and all its children, while `$\{executedProject}` is the project where you typed your `mvn` command.

### What is a Snapshot?

A snapshot is a development version. e.g, 2.0-SNAPSHOT is the "still-in-development future 2.0".
If you want to use a snapshot, juste use `<version>` , e.g. `<version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>`.
But first you must ensure that you have access to the repository containing this version.
For example, for Maven snapshots as stated below, you could use :

```xml

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>maven-snapshots</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

or, for plugins :

```xml

<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>maven-snapshots</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
```

Please refer to the following links

### How do I determine my project's transitive dependencies, and if needed, exclude a particular  transitive dependency?

To find out which of your dependencies is causing the problem, use `-X`on the mvn command line.
If necessary, you can redirect the output to a file with `> filename.txt`.

Then add an exclusion to that dependency in your pom.xml. Here's a
[post with some examples of exclusions](https://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.jakarta.tapestry.devel/9103).

### If two versions of the same dependency are at the same depth, how do you know or predict which version will be used?

The order in which dependencies are declared effectively becomes the tie-breaker when two dependency versions are
declared at the same depth. Example

```
A -> B, C
B -> D (v2)
C -> D (v3)
```

and A declares the following:

```xml

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <!-- ... -->
    <artifactId>B</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <!-- ... -->
    <artifactId>C</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Maven should choose `D (v2)` because `B` is declared first in the POM.

### How do I configure a project to use a specific version of a JDK?

Use the following plugin:

```xml

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <verbose>true</verbose>
    <fork>true</fork>
    <executable><!-- path-to-javac --></executable>
    <compilerVersion>1.3</compilerVersion>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Is there a way to use the current date in the POM?

Take a look at the buildnumber plugin. It can be used to generate a build date each time I do a build, as follows:

```xml

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-buildnumber-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.4</version>
  <configuration>
    <format>{0,date,yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}</format>
    <items>
      <item>timestamp</item>
    </items>
    <doCheck>false</doCheck>
    <doUpdate>false</doUpdate>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>validate</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>create</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

The build date is available as `$buildNumber` in my POMs and resource files.

### What is the purpose of remote repository (other than ibilbilo)?

To store stuff that is not in ibiblio. An example of this is your own stuff.

### Whenever a file is modified in a maven project how is the SNAPSHOT jar updated in the remote repository?

Using mvn deploy, after inserting proper `<distributionManagement/>` section into your POM

### Is maven 'deploy' goal and actually copying of a dependency or artifact jar to remote repository same?

Actually, simply copying the artifact to the repository is not the same as using deploy. The `deploy` goal will update
various metadata files, create the md5 and sha1 checksum files, and can optionally create missing POM files etc. along
with actually copying the artifact file.
So there is a significant difference between the copying the file and using deploy.

### When I run `mvn release:prepare`, I get a build failure saying "Unable to tag SCM, File (...) already exists".

When I run `mvn release:prepare`, I get a build failure saying

> Unable to tag SCM, File (...) already exists

However, the tag does not exist. What is wrong?

The full failure will look something like this: `/stuff/tags/example/pom.xml`

```
[INFO\] Tagging release with the label stuff-1.0.0...
[INFO\] Executing: svn \--non-interactive copy \--file C:\DOCUME~1\G980143\LOCALS~1\Temp\maven-scm-1259783654.commit . http://www.example.com/subversion/repo/example/tags/stuff-1.0.0
[INFO\] Working directory: C:\projects\stuff\branches\1.0.x
[INFO\] \-----------------------------------------------------------------------\-
[ERROR\] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO\] \-----------------------------------------------------------------------\-
[INFO\] Unable to tag SCM
Provider message:
The svn tag command failed.
Command output:
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: File 'subversion/repo/example/tags/stuff-1.0.0/pom.xml' already exists
```

This will only happen in Subversion 1.5.x, and is due to a "changed behavior" in Subversion 1.5.0 and upwards. Maven and
Subversion people have at the time og writing not agreed upon who should fix it. A workaround is to downgrade Subversion
to version 1.4.4 and use that. Another is to manually copy the trunk/release branch to the tags directory, commit the
change and then edit the release.properties file to reflect the fact that tagging has been done.

### How do I filter resources in the war?

The best resource for filtering resources in the war can be found here:
[Adding filtering webresources](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/adding-filtering-webresources.html)

### Does maven support automated build and test from non-Java applications?

Maven does support non-Java applications such as C but with a limited capacity.

### What would be the appropriate way to enable inheritance of classes in the test hierarchy across modules during the test-compile phase of a multi-pom project?

### How do I read the version from the pom.xml and then using Java display the version on my application?

If you want to read a pom file, you can use the `MavenXpp3Reader#read(... )`.
But if you simply want to get the version of your currently running maven project inside your pom (which is usually the
case), you can simply do:

```java
/**
 * @parameter expression="${project.version}"
 */
private String version;
```

Also, if you have a maven project (similar to the contents of its pom except that inheritance is already applied) and
want to get its version, you can use `MavenProject#getVersion()`.

### How can I add two different source-directories to a project?

You can do this by using the maven-buildhelper-plugin. It allows you to add additional source directories.

### How do I add properties to a pom?

```xml

<properties>
  <myproperty>propertyvalue</myproperty>
</properties>
```

Then `$myproperty=propertyvalue`

### How do I replace `<attainGoal>` from Maven 1 in Maven 2?

I want to build a plugin with multiple goals. Some goals might be aliases and call other goals. How do I do that in Maven?

### Why do I get `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/codehaus/classworlds/Launcher` when I try to execute Maven?

This sometimes happens when `$M2_HOME` is not the same as your `$PATH`. That is, when `which mvn` does not match `$
M2_HOME/bin/mvn`.

### How to encrypt a secure password that includes an ampersand

If you want to `mvn --encrypt-password` a password with an ampersand you will get an error, e.g.
`mvn --encrypt-password test&Password`
On the one hand, the ampersand has to be encoded as entity with "&amp;". On the other hand the ampersand has to be
escaped
for the command line.
Result would be `mvn --encrypt-password test &Password`
Also a dollar sign ("$") has to be escaped for the command line.
