Maven projects use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) as issue tracking and project management application.

## Issue Management

Maven is composed of nearly [100 parts](/scm.html#Maven_Sources_Overview), each one having its own Jira project or component:
**see the [Maven Jira issues overview](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Maven+JIRA+issues+overview) to get a summary of open issues**.

Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be submitted to the following
issue management systems depending on which component is involved:

* Maven "core": <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG>

* Maven Website: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNGSITE>

* Maven Plugins: Please refer to the [Available Plugins](./plugins/index.html) page

* Maven Shared Components: Please refer to the [Shared Components](./shared/index.html) page

* Doxia: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DOXIA>

* JXR: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JXR>

* SCM: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCM>

* Wagon: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WAGON>

or for Central Repository: <https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MVNCENTRAL>
