# Committer Environment

## Introduction

This document describes how to set up the Maven committer environment\.

## Source File Encoding

When editing source files, make sure you use the right file encoding\. For the Maven project, UTF\-8 has been chosen as the default file encoding\. UTF\-8 is an encoding scheme for the Unicode character set that can encode all characters that Java can handle\. The source files should not contain the byte order mark \(BOM\)\. There are exceptions to this general rule\. For instance, properties files are encoded using ISO\-8859\-1 as per the JRE API, so please keep this in mind, too\.

## Maven Code Style

Refer to [Maven Code Style And Code Conventions](\./conventions/code\.html)

## Useful software

The Maven Team uses assorted software\. Here is a partial list:

- [Cygwin](https://www\.cygwin\.com/): collection of free software tools that allow various versions of Microsoft Windows to act somewhat like a Unix system
- [GnuPG](https://www\.gnupg\.org/): GNU Privacy Guard\.
