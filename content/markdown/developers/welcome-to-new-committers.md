# Guide for new Maven committers

First of all congratulations, thank you, and welcome to the fold\! If you are reading this you&apos;ve recently been voted in as committer on an Apache Maven project and there are a few things that need to be sorted out before you can participate fully\.

The first thing to get out of the way is sending in your contributor&apos;s license agreement \(CLA\)\. You can&apos;t participate at Apache until we have received your signed CLA, so go to the [Apache website](http://www\.apache\.org/licenses/\#clas), print out the CLA, sign it, and send it in ASAP\.

Once you&apos;ve dealt with your CLA, there are a some documents that pertain to Apache as a whole you should read:

- [How the ASF works](http://www\.apache\.org/foundation/how\-it\-works\.html)
- [Guide for new committers](http://www\.apache\.org/dev/new\-committers\-guide\.html)
- [The committers FAQ](http://www\.apache\.org/dev/committers\.html)
- [How voting works](http://www\.apache\.org/foundation/voting\.html) 

Here are the documents that pertain to Maven specifically:

- [Guide to Maven development](/guides/development/guide\-maven\-development\.html)
- [Setup your committer environment](/developers/committer\-environment\.html)

And here are the specifics on setting up your Git access:

- [Apache&apos;s Source Code Repository](http://www\.apache\.org/dev/version\-control\.html)

If you have any questions just ask\! We&apos;re here to help, and looking forward to working with you\!

The Maven Team\!
