# Introduction

The Maven [https://maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org) website is composed from:

- a main content,
- multiple components reference documentation, published for each component release.

And [Doxia](https://maven.apache.org/doxia/) website has the same dual structure.

These contents are stored in svn, and svnpubsub/svnwcsub maintains a working copy on the webservers in `/www/maven.apache.org/content` \(see [`svnwcsub` configured in infra Puppet](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/modules/svnwcsub/files/svnwcsub.conf#L123)\):

- `/` comes from [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/website/content/](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/website/content/)
- [`/components`](https://maven.apache.org/components) comes from [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/website/components/](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/website/components/)
- `/doxia` comes from [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/website/content/](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/doxia/website/content/)
- [`/doxia/components`](https://maven.apache.org/doxia/components) comes from [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/website/components/](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/website/components/)

and the link between main content and components reference documentation \(for example from `/plugins/maven-xxx-plugin` to internal `/components/plugins/maven-xxx-plugin`\) is done with symbolic links. These links are configured in `components.links` files in `content/resources/` and subdirectories, for example [plugins/components.links](https://github.com/apache/maven-site/blob/master/content/resources/plugins/components.links).

# How website publication works

Instructions on how to publish website content are split in separate documents:

- on every main content source commit \([maven-site.git](https://github.com/apache/maven-site) and [maven-doxia-site.git](https://github.com/apache/maven-doxia-site)\), main content rebuild and publish is triggered through Jenkins jobs \( [maven-site job](https://ci-maven.apache.org/job/Maven/job/maven-box/job/maven-site/) and [doxia-site job](https://ci-maven.apache.org/job/Maven/job/maven-box/job/maven-doxia-site/)\), which basically run `mvn site-deploy` \(it can be run locally if CI is off...\),
- on every Maven component release, release manager follows &quot;[deploying Maven components reference documentation](./deploy-component-reference-documentation.html)&quot;, eventually using [Component Reference Documentation Helper](./component-reference-documentation-helper.html) to easily prepare `svnmucc` command line.

# Analytics

As part of Privacy enhancements, the whole Maven site is moving to [Apache&apos;s Analytics infrastructure](https://privacy.apache.org/matomo/): see [Maven statistics](https://analytics.apache.org/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&date=yesterday&period=day&idSite=3).
