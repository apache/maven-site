# Introduction

This document gives step\-by\-step instructions for deploying the main Maven [https://maven\.apache\.org](/) website\.

**Obsolete** this documentation is obsolete: with the migration of site source to Git, Apache CMS is not used any more\. It is replaced by Git edit \(eventually through GitHub with the &quot;edit&quot; link accessible from breadcrumb\) followed by Jenkins job to build and commit to svnpubsub\.

See [Maven website introduction](\./index\.html) for instructions on the whole website publication\.

# Overview

Since December 2012, the overall website uses svnpubsub mechanism and the main website uses Apache CMS:

# How main website publication works

Maven main website \([https://maven\.apache\.org](https://maven\.apache\.org)\) is generated with [maven\-site\-plugin](/plugins/maven\-site\-plugin) from a source tree stored in svn: [https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk](https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk)\.

## Edit source content

You can edit source content in 2 ways:

1. use [the CMS UI](https://cms\.apache\.org/maven/) through your web browser: 
    - Go to [https://cms\.apache\.org/maven/](https://cms\.apache\.org/maven/)\.
    - Click link &quot;Get Maven Working Copy&quot;\.
    - Navigate to the content you want to modify\.
    - Once you have modified the content, commit with the button &quot;Submit&quot;\.
1. checkout the source content locally, modify it with your favorite text editor, eventually test the result \(`mvn site`\), then check\-in source modifications\.

After source tree is modified in svn, [a Buildbot job](http://ci\.apache\.org/builders/maven\-site\-staging) is triggered: 

1. it builds the HTML site using [maven\-site\-plugin](/plugins/maven\-site\-plugin): `mvn site`,
1. it publishes generated HTML content to [CMS staging svn area](https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/infra/websites/staging/maven/trunk/content/),
1. svnpubsub mecanism transfers svn CMS staging content to live CMS staging site: [http://maven\.staging\.apache\.org](http://maven\.staging\.apache\.org),
## Publish site content

If everything is good, **publish modifications** using [CMS publish](https://cms\.apache\.org/maven/publish) action\.

Under the hood:

1. CMS copies CMS staging svn area content to [website production svn area](https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven/content/),
1. svnpubsub mecanism transfers svn production content to live production site: [http://maven\.apache\.org](http://maven\.apache\.org)\.
# How Doxia website publication works

Doxia uses the exact same mecanisms:

- you can edit [svn source tree](https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/site/trunk) either locally or through [CMS UI](https://cms\.apache\.org/maven\-doxia/),
- [a Buildbot job](http://ci\.apache\.org/builders/maven\-doxia\-site\-staging) builds the site and updates [website staging svn area](https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/infra/websites/staging/maven\-doxia/trunk/content/),
- svnpubsub published to [live staging site](http://maven\-doxia\.staging\.apache\.org),
- if everything is good, **publish modifications** using [CMS publish](https://cms\.apache\.org/maven\-doxia/publish) action,
- CMS copies CMS staging svn area content to [website production svn area](https://svn\.apache\.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven\-doxia/content/),
- svnpubsub mecanism transfers svn production content to live production site: [http://maven\.apache\.org/doxia](http://maven\.apache\.org/doxia), with its [`extpaths.txt`](/doxia/extpaths\.txt)
