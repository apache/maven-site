This document describes how Maven developers should use JIRA, our issue management system.

## When To Create a JIRA Issue?

This section discusses when to create a JIRA issue versus just committing a change in Git (eventually through a PR).

- **Minor changes** such as code reformatting, documentation fixes, etc. that aren't going to impact other users
  can be committed without a JIRA issue.

- **Larger changes** such as bug fixes, API changes, significant refactoring, new classes, and pretty much any change
  of more than 100 lines, should have JIRA tickets.

Creating a JIRA issue and referring it in the commit comments simplifies tracking the changes that happen in a release,
using JIRA automatic release notes creation.

## How To Use Issue Details?

This section presents some conventions about the issue fields.

### Priority

Committers have the responsibility to realign priority by editing the issue.

*Reasoning*: having a correct release note

### Assignee

Committers can assign an issue to a specific committer that person seems to
be well placed to address it.

### Component/s

Committers have the responsibility to specify the correct component by editing the issue.

*Reasoning*: having a correct release note.

### Affects Version/s

By default, the Maven team considers that an issue which affects a given version also affects preceding versions. For example, an issue
that affects Maven 3.6.3 also affects 3.6.0, 3.6.1, 3.6.2.
If it is a regression, the committers should specify the affected versions.

*Reasoning*: having a correct release note.

### Fix Version/s

Update to correct version after merging to master.

### Time Tracking

The Maven team doesn't use this. Committers can if it helps them.
