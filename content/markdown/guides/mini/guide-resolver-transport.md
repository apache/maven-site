Historically, since Maven 2.x, the only transport used by Maven was Maven Wagon. Since the introduction of the Resolver in
Maven 3.x, it did "wrap" it in the `maven-resolver-transport-wagon` module, and continued to use it. Still, Wagon is
deeply integrated with the old Plexus DI container and many, if not all, of its configuration are bound to be set in
Plexus XML, which is not type safe, nor validated, nor future-proof.

**Starting with Maven 3.9.0 release, the _default transport_ (the default transport used by Maven Resolver)
changed from ancient Wagon to modern `maven-resolver-transport-http` aka _native HTTP_ transport.**

Take a peek at the Resolver [architecture diagram](https://maven.apache.org/resolver-archives/resolver-LATEST-1.x/) and the _transport_ box
contains several implementations, and this number will probably increase.

The Resolver contains configuration for many aspects, including transport (see the keys
prefixed with `aether.connector.`). They can be found on
[resolver configuration page](https://maven.apache.org/resolver-archives/resolver-LATEST-1.x/configuration.html).

**This page applies only to Maven 3.9.0 and newer.**

## Switching Between Transports

The transport used by resolver can be controlled using the `-Dmaven.resolver.transport` user property, for which accepted
values are `native` (the default), `wagon` (uses legacy Wagon) and `auto` (delegates to resolver to sort
out defaults).

The accepted values of `maven.resolver.transport` user property:
* `default` (implied if not present), does `auto` by default
* `native` forces use of transport-http
* `wagon` forces use of transport-wagon
* `auto` delegates to the resolver the transport choice (using `aether.priority.<class>` and related properties, or just relying on component priorities).

Note: _forces_ means that the resolver will use the given transport even if another higher prioritized component is present
on classpath.

Given the priority of `native` is higher than `wagon`, and that starting with Maven 3.9.0 both are present on resolver
classpath, `native` is chosen by default. This behaviour preserves existing (pre 3.9.0) behaviour of Maven Resolver,
that allowed third party transports to be added (by copying them to `lib/ext`) that have higher priorities. Still,
fallback is possible with explicit use of `native` or `wagon` values.

## Custom HTTP Headers

In all HTTP transports, you can add your custom HTTP headers like this:

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>my-server</id>
      <configuration>
        <httpHeaders>
          <property>
            <name>Foo</name>
            <value>Bar</value>
          </property>
        </httpHeaders>
      </configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

It is important to understand that the above approach does not allow you to turn off all the default HTTP headers;
nor does it allow you to specify headers on a per-method basis. However, this configuration remains available in all
transports that support headers, like HTTP transports are (and works for "native" but also Wagon transport).

## Timeouts

All transport implementations that perform some network access allow configuring several timeouts,
for example to allow the user to tell Maven how long to wait before giving up on a connection that has not responded.

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>my-server</id>
      <configuration>
        <connectTimeout>10000</connectTimeout> <!-- milliseconds -->
        <requestTimeout>1800000</requestTimeout> <!-- milliseconds -->
      </configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

## Low-level Resolver configuration

All configuration items mentioned in  [Configuration Options](https://maven.apache.org/resolver-archives/resolver-LATEST-1.x/configuration.html)
which are not mapped by `server/configuration` (eg.httpHeaders, timeout) tag must be provided in special way.

Some resolver configuration properties has a flag `Supports Repo ID Suffix`.

If you use property like:

```
aether.connector.http.preemptiveAuth=true
```

it means that `preemptiveAuth` will be applied for all of your repositories.

You can also add suffix to property with your repository ID in order to configure only for selected repository.

```
aether.connector.http.preemptiveAuth.myRepositoryId=true
```

it means that `preemptiveAuth` will be applied only for repository or mirror which has `id` as `myRepositoryId`

### System level

Configuration can be provided on global level as properties in `settings.xml`

```xml
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>resolver-config</id>
      <properties>
        <aether.dependencyCollector.impl>bf</aether.dependencyCollector.impl>
        <!-- set preemptiveAuth for all repositories -->
        <aether.connector.http.preemptiveAuth>true</aether.connector.http.preemptiveAuth>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>

  <activeProfiles>
    <!-- profile with configuration properties must be activated here -->
    <activeProfile>resolver-config</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
</settings>
```

**NOTICE**
- only profiles activated by `settings/activeProfiles` will be taken for consideration - you can not use `profile/activation` in such case

You can also use environment variable `MAVEN_OPTS` ot `MAVEN_ARGS`

```
export MAVEN_ARGS="-Daether.connector.http.preemptiveAuth=true"
```

### Project level

You can add configuration items per project in `.mvn/maven.config`, like:

```
-Daether.dependencyCollector.impl=bf
```

### Execution level

For particular execution can be provided as user settings on command line:

```
$ mvn ... -Daether.enhancedLocalRepository.split \
          -Daether.enhancedLocalRepository.localPrefix=maven-resolver/mresolver-253
          -Daether.enhancedLocalRepository.splitRemoteRepository
```

## How To Upgrade from Wagon? (or "native transport does not work")

If your build environment uses Wagon specific configuration (in `settings.xml` or alike), you should migrate your
configuration first. You can still upgrade and use latest Maven, with use `-Dmaven.resolver.transport=wagon` user property
to stick with Wagon, but migration to new transport is warmly recommended.

## Per Transport configuration details

Depending on which transport you use (`native`, `wagon` or something else), you will want to refer to the corresponding
page(s) for detailed configuration options:

* For Native HTTP transport detailed configuration user properties are [collected on this page](https://maven.apache.org/resolver-archives/resolver-LATEST-1.x/configuration.html).
* For Wagon you want to use `-Dmaven.resolver.transport=wagon` user property and [configuration from this page](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-http-settings.html).
* For any third party transport, please refer to its own documentation.
