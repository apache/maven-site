# Guide to helping with Maven

As with any open source project, there are several ways you can help:

- Join the [mailing lists](../../mailing-lists.html) and answer other user's questions.
- Report bugs, feature requests and other issues in the [issue management system](../../issue-management.html).
- [Build Maven](./guide-building-maven.html) for yourself, in order to fix bugs.
- [Submit patches](./guide-maven-development.html#Creating_and_submitting_a_patch) to reported issues (both those you find, or that others have filed).
  If you consider picking up larger chunks of work, please reach out on the [dev@maven.apache.org list](../../mailing-lists.html) to discuss if the idea and solution strategy might work.
- [Test releases](./guide-testing-releases.html) help test releases that are being voted on (see the [dev@maven.apache.org list](../../mailing-lists.html) for release votes)
- [Test snapshot plugins](./guide-testing-development-plugins.html) help testing the latest development versions of plugins and report issues
- Help improving the documentation by pointing out areas that are lacking or are unclear.
  If you want, submit Pull Requests to correct it.
  Just use the "edit" button in the breadcrumb (next to the page title).
  You can also create appropriate issues [by using the issue management system](https://github.com/apache/maven-site/issues).

Your participation in the community is much appreciated!

# Why Would I Want to Help?

There are several reasons from which you benefit yourself.

- By answering other people's questions, you can learn more for yourself
- By submitting your own fixes, they get incorporated faster
- By reporting issues, you ensure that bugs don't get missed, or forgotten
- You are giving back to a community that has given you software for free

# How do I Join the Project?

Projects at Apache operate under a meritocracy, meaning those that the developers notice participating in a high extent will be invited to join the project as a committer.

This is as much based on personality and ability to work with other developers and the community as it is with proven technical ability.
Being unhelpful to other users, or obviously looking to become a committer for bragging rights and nothing else is frowned upon, as is asking to be made a committer without having contributed sufficiently to be invited.

# Developers Conventions

There are a number of conventions used in the project, which contributors and developers alike should follow for consistency's sake.

- [Maven Code Style And Convention](../../developers/conventions/code.html)
- [Maven Git Convention](../../developers/conventions/git.html)
- [Releasing a Maven project](../../developers/release/index.html)
- [Apache Maven Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Index)
