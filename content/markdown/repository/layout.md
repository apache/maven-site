(See [Repository Layout- Final](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVENOLD/Repository+Layout+-+Final))

The Maven repository layout format has this hierarchy:

```
Repository root
|-- archetype-catalog.xml
`-- ${groupId as directory}/
    |-- maven-metadata.xml
    |--                   .${checksums}
    `-- ${artifactId}/
        |-- maven-metadata.xml
        |--                   .${checksums}
        `-- ${version}/
            |-- ${artifactId}-${version}.pom
            |--                             .asc
            |--                             .${checksums}
            |-- ${artifactId}-${version}.${extension}
            |--                                     .asc
            |--                                     .${checksums}
            |-- ${artifactId}-${version}-${classifier}.${extension}
            |--                                                    .asc
            `--                                                    .${checksums}
```

where:

- `${groupId as directory}` is the groupId with `.` replaced by `/`, for example `org/apache/maven`,
- `${artifactId}` is the artifactId,
- `${version}` is the version, with some additional possibilities on a SNAPSHOT, see SNAPSHOT paragraph,
- `${extension}` is the file extension, for example `zip` or `tar.gz`,
- `${classifier}` is the artifact classifier (when available),
- `${checksums}` is a list of checksums algorithms, `md5` and `sha1` by default.

`maven-metadata.xml` file format is defined in [Maven Repository Metadata Model](/ref/current/maven-repository-metadata/).

`.asc` file is optional (may be required in some repositories, like Central Repository) and is a PGP detached signature file.

Obviously, `${groupId}`, `${artifactId}` and `${version}` are defined in `pom.xml`. But what about `${classifier}` and `${extension}`, how are they defined?

Classifier and extension definition is completely different at artifact *publication* and *usage* times:

- **At artifact publication time**: Extension and classifier are defined by plugins that create the artifacts and attach them for publication.<br />
  Some plugins provide configuration parameters to be able to override default values.
  For example, [Maven JAR Plugin's `jar:jar` goal](/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/jar-mojo.html) produces by default an artifact with `jar` extension and empty classifier.
  The `classifier` goal parameter can be used to define a classifier (there is no parameter to override extension).

- **At artifact usage time**: Extension and classifier are defined by [`<dependency>`'s `<type>` and `<classifier>`](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html#class_dependency) definition in `pom.xml`:

  - `<type>` (`jar` by default) defines the extension and default classifier: <br />
    see [default artifact handlers](/ref/current/maven-core/artifact-handlers.html) to see default types and corresponding extension and default classifier. <br />
  - `<classifier>` is optional, to override default classifier defined by the dependency type.

## SNAPSHOT

In case of a SNAPSHOT version, version directory uses base version, i.e. version ending in `-SNAPSHOT`, for example `3.8.4-SNAPSHOT`.

For artifact files, there are 2 options available:

1. unique SNAPSHOT artifacts, using the same base version,
2. multiple SNAPSHOT artifacts for one base version, each deployment will have an effective version where `SNAPSHOT` is replaced with `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS-${counter}`.

## Protocol

Repository can be accessed through many file-oriented protocols, both for read and write: most classical are `file://`, `http://` and `https://` (`GET` and `PUT`).
Older (now generally unused) protocols are FTP(S), SCP, SSH, ...

HTTP/HTTPS protocol have 2 specific characteristics:

1. there is no directory listing feature: Maven does not need to list files in a directory, a remote directory does have not provide any directory listing feature,

2. [HTTP/1.1 Reason-Phrase](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html) is used to provide extended message when artifact access is rejected by remote repository.
   This usage of Reason-Phrase is nowadays legacy and is removed in HTTP/2, [MNG-6795](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6795) is open to create a replacement.

## Archetype Catalog

`archetype-catalog.xml` file at root directory is a [catalog of all Maven Archetypes](/archetype/archetype-models/archetype-catalog/archetype-catalog.html) proposed in the repository.

## Additional Content

### Index

[`.index`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/.index/) directory at root directory is an [index](/maven-indexer/indexer-core/) of the content, done by [Maven Indexer](/maven-indexer/).

If contains index files in 2 flavours:

- full index: `nexus-maven-repository-index.gz`
- incremental index: `nexus-maven-repository-index.<n>.gz` + `nexus-maven-repository-index.properties`

### Metadata

[`.meta`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/.meta/) directory at root directory contains a few metadata files:

- `prefixes.txt`
- `repository-metadata.xml`
