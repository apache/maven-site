All popular development environments for the Java platform and beyond support 
Apache Maven with numerous features out of the box. The following list iterates 
popular IDEs in alphabetical order:

## Apache NetBeans IDE

Apache NetBeans includes full Maven support since 6.7, including Maven 3 support in 7.0+. 
You can open any Maven project in the IDE and start coding immediately.

For more information see the [NetBeans.org wiki page](http://wiki.netbeans.org/Maven).

## Eclipse IDE - M2Eclipse

  [M2Eclipse ](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) is 
  the official Eclipse project for Maven integration for the Eclipse IDE.
  
Features include:

- Launching Maven builds from within Eclipse
- Dependency management for Eclipse build path based on Maven's pom.xml
- Resolving Maven dependencies from the Eclipse workspace without installing to local Maven repository
- Automatic downloading of the required dependencies and sources from the remote Maven repositories
- Wizards for creating new Maven projects, pom.xml and to enable Maven support on existing projects
- Quick search for dependencies in remote Maven repositories
- Quick fixes in the Java editor for looking up required dependencies/jars by the class or package name
- Integration with other Eclipse tools, such as WTP, AJDT, Mylyn, Subclipse and others.

M2E dynamically integrates with your Maven projects with Eclipse while you make changes in the IDE. As 
you change dependencies, or configurations of Maven plugins in your POMs M2E, will synchronize the 
Eclipse workspace with those changes.

## JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA has a [feature-rich integration for Maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/maven.html).
