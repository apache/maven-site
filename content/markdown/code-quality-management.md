Some existing Maven plugins use code analysis technologies (like
[Checkstyle][Checkstyle], [PMD][PMD], [JDepend][JDepend], ...) to generate various quality reports. This
page lists technologies and platforms that know how to aggregate all
this information to offer enhanced quality management functionalities.

## Quality management technologies and platforms

Following is an alphabetical list of those we've heard mentioned around
the Maven community:

- [Hudson](https://hudson-ci.org)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org)
- [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/)
- [Squale](http://www.squale.org/)
- [XRadar](http://xradar.sourceforge.net)
