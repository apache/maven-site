A repository manager is a dedicated server application designed to manage
repositories of binary components.

The usage of a repository manager is
considered an essential best practice for any significant usage of Maven.

## Purpose

A repository manager serves these essential purposes:

* act as dedicated proxy server for public Maven repositories
  (see [Maven Guide to Mirror Settings](./guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html))
* provide repositories as a deployment destination for your Maven project
  outputs

## Benefits and Features

Using a repository manager provides the following benefits and features:

* significantly reduced number of downloads off remote repositories, saving time
  and bandwidth resulting in increased build performance
* improved build stability due to reduced reliance on external repositories
* increased performance for interaction with remote SNAPSHOT repositories
* potential for control of consumed and provided artifacts
* creates a central storage and access to artifacts and meta data about them
  exposing build outputs to consumer such as other projects and developers, but
  also QA or operations teams or even customers
* provides an effective platform for exchanging binary artifacts within
  your organization and beyond without the need for building artifact from source
