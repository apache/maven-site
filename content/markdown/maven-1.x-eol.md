-   the latest 1.x release will be removed from the mirror system
-   the 1.x branch in svn will move from /maven/maven-1/ to
    /maven/archives/maven-1/
-   the links to the 1.x documentation will be moved from
    https://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/ to
    https://maven.apache.org/archives/maven-1.x/
