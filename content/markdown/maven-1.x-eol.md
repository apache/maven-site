  branch
- the 1.x download pages will be removed.
- the latest 1.x release will be removed from the mirror system
- the 1.x branch in svn will move from /maven/maven-1/ to
  /maven/archives/maven-1/
- the links to the 1.x documentation will be moved from
  https://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/ to
  https://maven.apache.org/archives/maven-1.x/

The Apache Maven Team.
