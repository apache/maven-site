# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.6.2

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.6.2.

Maven 3.6.2 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

- the website: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.2/](/ref/3.6.2/)

## Overview about the changes

- This release focuses mostly performance improvements, better memory footprint, and less CPU usage.

- We are continuing to convert Maven Core to use JSR 330 annotations instead of Plexus (still not finished, see [MNG-5577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5577)).

- New support for 'release' qualifier (see [MNG-6655](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6655)).

- The toolchain.xml file supports environment variables (see [MNG-6665](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6665)).
