# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.5.2

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.5.2.

Maven 3.5.2 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [plugins list][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the website: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html][3]
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.5.2/][4]
