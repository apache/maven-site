# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.5.4

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.5.4

Maven 3.5.4 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.5.4/](/ref/3.5.4/)

## Known Issues

At the time of release, there are no known regressions introduced by this release

## Overview about the changes

This release is primarily aimed to resolve the two regressions introduced in the 3.5.3 release, specifically [MNG-6372][] and [MNG-6388][].

There are some additional minor improvements, the most notable of which is:

- The Maven Super POM changes the default execution of the `maven-source-plugin` `jar` goal into `jar-no-fork` which should resolve some issues complex projects had running releases.

## [The detailed issue list](#Details)

### Bugs

- [MNG-6370][] `ConcurrencyDependencyGraph#getNumberOfBuilds()` does not remove finished projects from unfinished ones
- [MNG-6372][] On Windows Maven can output spurious ANSI escapes such as `[0m [0m`
- [MNG-6382][] JANSI fails frequently with `NumberFormatException` when building in parallel
- [MNG-6386][] `${project.baseUri}` is not a valid URI (according to RFC 3986)
- [MNG-6388][] Error Fetching Artifacts: "`[B cannot be cast to java.lang.String`"
- [MNG-6403][] `Artifact#VERSION_FILE_PATTERN` does not escape period between date and time
- [MNG-6410][] Add `groupId` to `--resume-from` suggestion if `artifactId` is not unique in reactor

### Improvements

- [MNG-5756][] Java home output in `mvn -v` is misleading
- [MNG-5940][] Change the `maven-source-plugin` `jar` goal into `jar-no-fork` in Maven Super POM

- [MNG-6364][] Enhanced `Jenkinsfile` to test Core with JDK 9
- [MNG-6411][] Improve readability of project list returned when `--resume-from` option value is invalid

### Tasks
