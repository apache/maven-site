# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.5.0

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.5.0.

Maven 3.5.0 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM),
Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See
the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [http://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [http://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html][3]
- the reference documentation: [http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.5.0/][4]

## Why not Maven 3.4.0?

After Maven 3.3.9 was released, the Eclipse Aether project was retired and the code base was migrated to the Apache
Maven project.

The original goal for the 3.4.0 release was to replace Aether with the exact same code after migration to the Apache
Maven project and then proceed with bug fixes to the resolver code as well as other areas of Maven.

The migration of the code between the two foundations took longer than expected and as a result there were other changes
committed to Maven core that were outside the scope of intent for 3.4.0.

In order to refocus on the original intent for 3.4.0, the decision was taken to revert the Maven core history to the
point of the 3.3.9 release and merge in the desired changes one at a time.

Because there had been a lot of communication about different features being delivered and bugs fixed in Maven 3.4.0 and
the new history may not contain them in the first release, the decision was taken to forever burn the 3.4.x release
line.

More detail on this decision can be read in the [mailing list archive][5].

## Overview about the changes

- The most obvious change you may encounter is that the console output has colors now [MNG-3507][], [MNG-6093][].

- The new `project.directory` special property adds support in every calculated URLs (project, SCM, site) for module
  directory name that does not match artifactId [MNG-5878][]

- The `JAVA_HOME` discovery has been reduced to simply check if `JAVA_HOME` is set or not then trying to discover via
  `which java`, nothing more [MNG-6003][].

- The build bootstrapping support via Apache Ant has been removed. You can now only bootstrap Maven build with a
  previous version of Maven, but not with Ant anymore [MNG-5904][].

- Based on problems in using `M2_HOME` related to different Maven versions installed and to simplify things, the usage
  of `M2_HOME` has been removed and is not supported anymore [MNG-5823][], [MNG-5836][], [MNG-5607][].

- Important change for windows users: The usage of `%HOME%` has been replaced with `%USERPROFILE%` [MNG-6001][]

- Several issues have been reported and fixed related to the `mvn` script either for Unix/Linux/Cygwin/Solaris or for
  Windows [MNG-5815][], [MNG-5852][], [MNG-5963][], [MNG-6022][].

- In Maven 3.3.9, we have removed bindings for maven-ejb3-plugin because it does not exist. We follow-up and removed the
  artifact handler for `ejb3` and the `par` lifecycles [MNG-6014][], [MNG-6017][].

- In previous Maven versions, there had been a larger problem related to memory usage in case of very large reactors (
  200-300 modules or more) which caused failures with out of memory exceptions or the need to increase the memory
  settings. This problem has been fixed with [MNG-6030][].

- If you have defined a property within the `.mvn/maven.config` file, it was not possible to overwrite the property via
  command line. This has been fixed with [MNG-6078][].

- If you have are using `<prerequisites>..</prerequisites>` for a non maven-plugin project, you will get a WARNING which
  looks like this:

          [INFO] Scanning for projects...
          [WARNING] The project org.apache.maven:maven:pom:3.5.0 uses prerequisites which is only intended for maven-plugin projects but not for non maven-plugin projects. For such purposes you should use the maven-enforcer-plugin. See https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/requireMavenVersion.html

  This will tell you to use [maven-enforcer-plugin][] to check the version of Maven you are expecting to build your
  project with, instead of using `prerequisites` [MNG-5297][], [MNG-6092][].

- Replaced Eclipse Aether with [Maven Resolver][maven-resolver] [MNG-6110][], [MNG-6140][].

- Using of CI friendly versions via `${revision}`, `${sha1}` and/or `${changelist}` has been
  fixed [MNG-6057][], [MNG-6090][] and [MNG-5895][]. It is very important to know if you are using the previously named
  properties for a version in your pom you have to use [flatten-maven-plugin] if you like to do an `mvn install` or
  `mvn deploy` more details can be found at [Maven CI Friendly Versions](/guides/mini/guide-maven-ci-friendly.html).
