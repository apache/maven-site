# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.5.0-alpha-1

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.5.0-alpha-1.

<div class="alert alert-error" role="alert">
<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>This is an <i>ALPHA</i> release. There is the potential that features may be added/removed between this release and the first GA release in the 3.5.x release line.</p>
<p><i>Please consult the Known Issues section below before use</i></p> 
</div>

Maven 3.5.0-alpha-1 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
(POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately.
See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [http://maven.apache.org/](/)
- the maven-user mailing list: [http://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.5.0-alpha-1/](/ref/3.5.0-alpha-1/)

## Known Issues

The following issues were identified during release testing of this _ALPHA_ release but have not been deemed as release blockers:

* [MNG-6177] The `--file` and `-f` option to specify a `pom.xml` to use does not work if the path includes characters that need quoting such as whitespace or `&`.
* [MNG-6115] If Maven is installed in a writable location, every build will create a new `lib/ext/jansi-....` file.

## Why not Maven 3.4.0?

After Maven 3.3.9 was released, the Eclipse Aether project was retired and the code base was migrated to the Apache Maven project.

The original goal for the 3.4.0 release was to replace Aether with the exact same code after migration to the Apache Maven project and then proceed with bug fixes to the resolver code as well as other areas of Maven.

The migration of the code between the two foundations took longer than expected and as a result there were other changes committed to Maven core that were outside the scope of intent for 3.4.0.

In order to refocus on the original intent for 3.4.0, the decision was taken to revert the Maven core history to the point of the 3.3.9 release and merge in the desired changes one at a time.

Because there had been a lot of communication about different features being delivered and bugs fixed in Maven 3.4.0 and the new history may not contain them in the first release, the decision was taken to forever burn the 3.4.x release line.

More detail on this decision can be read in the [mailing list archive](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@maven.apache.org/msg112103.html).

## Preliminary Testers

Thank you also for your time and feedback.

## Overview about the changes

* The most obvious change you may encounter is that the console output
  has colors now [MNG-3507], [MNG-6093].

* The new `project.directory` special property adds support in every calculated URLs (project, SCM, site)
  for module directory name that does not match artifactId [MNG-5878]

* The `JAVA_HOME` discovery has been reduced to simply check if `JAVA_HOME` is set
  or not then trying to discover via `which java`, nothing more [MNG-6003].

* The build bootstrapping support via Apache Ant has been removed. You can now only bootstrap Maven
  build with a previous version of Maven, but not with Ant any more [MNG-5904].

* Based on problems in using `M2_HOME` related to different Maven versions installed and
  to simplify things, the usage of `M2_HOME` has been removed and is not
  supported any more [MNG-5823], [MNG-5836], [MNG-5607].

* Important change for windows users: The usage of `%HOME%` has been replaced
  with `%USERPROFILE%` [MNG-6001]

* Several issues have been reported and fixed related to the `mvn` script either
  for Unix/Linux/Cygwin/Solaris or for Windows
  [MNG-5815], [MNG-5852], [MNG-5963], [MNG-6022].

* In Maven 3.3.9, we have removed bindings for maven-ejb3-plugin because it
  does not exist. We follow-up and removed the artifact handler for `ejb3`
  and the `par` lifecycle [MNG-6014], [MNG-6017].

* In previous Maven versions, there had been a larger problem related to
  memory usage in case of very large reactors (200-300 modules or more)
  which caused failures with out of memeory exceptions or the need to increase
  the memory settings. This problem has been fixed with [MNG-6030].

* If you have defined a property within the `.mvn/maven.config` file,
  it was not possible to overwrite the property via command line.
  This has been fixed with [MNG-6078][MNG-6078].

* If you have are using `<prerequisites>..</prerequisites>` for a non
  maven-plugin project, you will get a WARNING which looks like this:

```
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[WARNING] The project org.apache.maven:maven:pom:3.5.0-SNAPSHOT uses prerequisites which is only intended for maven-plugin projects but not for non maven-plugin projects. For such purposes you should use the maven-enforcer-plugin. See https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/requireMavenVersion.html
```

This will tell you to use maven-enforcer-plugin to check the version of Maven
you are expecting to build your project with, instead of using `prerequisites`
[MNG-5297], [MNG-6092].

* Replaced Eclipse Aether with [Maven Resolver][maven-resolver]
  [MNG-6110], [MNG-6140].
