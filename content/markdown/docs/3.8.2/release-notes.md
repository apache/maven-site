# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.8.2

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.8.2.

Maven 3.8.2 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.8.2/](/ref/3.8.2/)

## Overview About the Changes

This release mainly contains fixes and non-invasive backports from Maven 4.0.0-alpha-1.

The full list of changes can be found in our [issue management system][4].

## Known Issues

- If any of your plugin mojos spawns new threads there might be a change in class loading as a
  result of the fix for [MNG-6843][6]. See [discussion][7] with a possible fix for your plugin
  mojo as well as a potential general fix in [MNG-7212][8].
- If any or your projects relies on a Maven Core artifacts and your build is perfomed with Maven 3.8.1
  or later a transitive dependency parent of Sisu Plexus/CPI API 1.0 will inject a remote repository
  over HTTP which will be blocked by default and (might) lead to build failures. See [discussion][9]
  and [MNG-7214][10] for details.
- [MNG-7170][11] has caused a regression where non-reactor projects have basedir set and plugins as
  well as other components make false assumptions. See [discussion][12] and [MNG-7215][13] for details.
- [MNG-6886][14] has caused a regression where `plexus-cipher` with the `org.sonatype.plexus` group id was
  globally excluded, but not all affected modules were updated to depend on this dependency directly with
  the `org.codehaus.plexus` group id. See [discussion][15] for details.
