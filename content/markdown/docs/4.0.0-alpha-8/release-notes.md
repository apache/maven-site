# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 4.0.0-alpha-8

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 4.0.0-alpha-8.

This is alpha release, not suitable for production.

Maven 4.0.0-alpha-8 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/4.0.0-alpha-8/](/ref/4.0.0-alpha-8/)

## Overview About the Changes

This alpha release provides new cornerstone features for the future Maven evolution.  
In particular, the POM model which was set in stone to a 4.0.0 version since Maven 2.0, is now able to evolve. For modules that have a packaging which is not POM, the flattened consumer POM is now installed/deployed instead of the main POM, eventually translated back into a 4.0.0 model version for consumer compatibility.  The build POM is also installed / deployed unchanged with `build` classifier. This allows the introduction of the 4.1.0 model which already brings a few improvements.

The full list of changes can be found in our [issue management system][4]. Among those are:
- switch from [Plexus XML](https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/plexus-xml/) to StAX / [Woodstox](https://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox) for XML parsing
- support for alternative POM syntaxes
- introduce a 4.1.0 model version
- add flexible goal ordering (in 4.1.0 model)
- allow glob patterns in dependency exclusions
- support proxy port interpolation in `settings.xml`
- add support for TRACE logging level (with style "bold,magenta")
- add model version analysis and downgrade
- attach the build POM (with `build` clasifier) and simplify the build/consumer implementation
- add a new BOM packaging
- trim down the consumer POM
- expose the rootDirectory for model processing
- support configuration in `extensions.xml` / `\<extension>` elements (in 4.1.0 model)
- generic `.uri` suffix to get the URI representation of any file property
- allow registering Maven core extension in `.m2` directory instead of `MAVEN_HOME`
- colorize transfer messages
- the `root` attribute introduced in alpha-7 has been moved to the new 4.1.0 model

## Known Issues

If you find any incompatibility with latest versions of plugins, do not hesitate to report those.
