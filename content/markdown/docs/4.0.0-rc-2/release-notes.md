# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 4.0.0-rc-2

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 4.0.0-rc-2.

Maven 4 release **requires Java 17 for runtime**.

This is release candidate release, **is not suitable for production**.

Maven 4.0.0-rc-2 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/4.0.0-rc-2/](/ref/4.0.0-rc-2/)

## Overview About the Changes

The full list of changes can be found in our [issue management system][4].

Notable changes include:
* **requires Java 17 as "minimum runtime Java requirement"**
* brings the latest Maven Resolver 2.0.5
* many bug fixes and enhancements since rc-1

Maven has entered the release candidate phase and aims to be finally released in a few weeks.  Please give it a try and report errors.

# Upgrading from Maven 3

Maven 4 brings a tons of changes.  We've tried hard to maximise compatibility with Maven 3.x, but in order to have your build work with Maven 4, you will need to upgrade some plugins (such as `maven-enforcer-plugin`, `maven-remote-resources-plugin`, `maven-shade-plugin`, etc...) to their most recent versions.

If your build is leveraging Maven extensions, you may very well expect some breakage. Some extensions may need to be updated:
* the useful, but unmaintained, [`os-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin/) extension has been forked and now maintained at [`os-detector-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/tisonkun/os-detector)

Contact the extensions' developers team to know their plans regarding supporting to Maven 4.

## Known issues

* the `mvnenc` tool used to encrypt passwords in settings is broken
* download rates appearing in the console display wrong values
