# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 4.0.0-alpha-10

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 4.0.0-alpha-10.

This is alpha release, not suitable for production.

Maven 4.0.0-alpha-10 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

- the website: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/4.0.0-alpha-10/](/ref/4.0.0-alpha-10/)
