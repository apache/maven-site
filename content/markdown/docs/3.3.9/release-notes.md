# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.3.9

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.3.9.

Maven 3.3.9 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
(POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately.
See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [http://maven.apache.org/](/)
- the maven-user mailing list: [http://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.9/](/ref/3.3.9/)

Improvements
------------

* The `par` lifecycle has been removed from the default life cycle bindings and the maven-ejb3-plugin
  has been removed from default bindings, cause it does not exist [MNG-5892][MNG-5892], [MNG-5894][MNG-5894].

* The default bindings defined two different versions for the [maven-resources-plugin][maven-resources-plugin]
  which has been fixed by [MNG-5893][MNG-5893].

* Switch to official [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation) 4.0, upgrade to
  [Eclipse/Sisu](https://www.eclipse.org/sisu/) 0.3.2 has been done with [MNG-5923][MNG-5923] and [MNG-5924][MNG-5924].

* Several areas of Maven Core have been changed to use
  [Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/)'s Validate to intercept invalid
  input [MNG-5649][MNG-5649].

* Upgrade Java minimum version prerequisite from Java 6 to Java 7 [MNG-5780][MNG-5780].

* Custom packaging types: configuring DefaultLifecycleMapping mojo executions [MNG-5805][MNG-5805].

* Disallow the programmatic injection of project dependencies [MNG-5818][MNG-5818].

* Close IO streams in finally or try-with-resource statement [MNG-5844][MNG-5844].

* Make url inheritance algorithm more visible [MNG-5871][MNG-5871].

* Update used [Modello](https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/modello/) version from 1.8.1 to 1.8.3 [MNG-5888][MNG-5888].

* Maven build does not work with Maven 2.2.1 [MNG-5905][MNG-5905].

* Use canonical name for UTC timezone [MNG-5906][MNG-5906].

* Upgrade [maven-parent](/pom/maven/) to version 27 [MNG-5911][MNG-5911].

* Upgrade [Wagon](/wagon/) version to 2.10 [MNG-5915][MNG-5915].

* Upgraded to [plexus-component-*](https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/plexus-containers/) 1.6 that uses
  [asm](http://asm.ow2.org/) 5.x [MNG-5921][MNG-5921].

* Upgrade [plexus-utils](https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/plexus-utils/) to 3.0.22 to support `combine.id` as configuration attribute for Map merging [MNG-5922][MNG-5922].

* Update [animal-sniffer-maven-plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/animal-sniffer/animal-sniffer-maven-plugin/) to 1.14. MANIMALSNIFFER-49 required when building with JDK9 [MNG-5925][MNG-5925].

Bugs
----

* Moving from Maven 3.0.5 to 3.3.3 breaks plugins with some dependencies on the classpath.
  This has been fixed with [MNG-5787][MNG-5787].

* The Cygwin Shell related handling of the `MAVEN_PROJECTBASEDIR` has been fixed
  with [MNG-5812][MNG-5812].

* The scripts to call Maven has introduced a bug related to the handling of the
  `MAVEN_OPTS` and debugging options which has been fixed by [MNG-5813][MNG-5813].

* Since Maven 3.3.1 it is possible to have configurations stored on a per project base in the
  `.mvn` directory of the project. There you can use the `maven.config`
  file to store command line options instead of repeating them every time you call Maven.
  In cases where this file has been empty Maven ended with a failure. This has been fixed
  with [MNG-5816][MNG-5816].

* The handling of the relativePath in a parent has been fixed related to the case
  that the parent has the same groupId:artifactId but a different version. In this
  case the resolution must be done against the repository.
  This has been fixed by [MNG-5840][MNG-5840].

* In cases where you start Maven in the root of a windows drive Maven will fail.
  This has been fixed by [MNG-5796][MNG-5796].

* The `<prerequisites>` elements is intended for [buildtime checking but not for runtime checks][MNG-4840]
  which should be left to [maven-enforcer-plugin][maven-enforcer-plugin].
  This has not been documented accordingly. This has been done with [MNG-5297][MNG-5297].

* In situations like this: `mvn -Dtest=\"anton\" clean package` the trailing quote
  is stripped away which could cause problems. This has been fixed with [MNG-5681][MNG-5681].

* Possible NullPointerException in org.apache.maven.repository.MetadataResolutionResult
  has been fixed with [MNG-5721].

* There had been several issues with the `mvn` script which are for example
  wrong locating the `.mvn` directory, nonportable shell constructs, wrongly setting
  'maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory' variable or directories which contain spaces. Those
  issues have been fixed [MNG-5786][MNG-5786], [MNG-5858][MNG-5858],
  [MNG-5882][MNG-5882] and [MNG-5884][MNG-5884].

* Broken link of 'Building Maven' in README.md has been fixed by [MNG-5886][MNG-5886].

* [maven-aether-provider][maven-aether-provider]/[maven-compat][maven-compat]
  does not always generate snapshot versions using Gregorian calendar year
  fixed in [MNG-5877][MNG-5877]

* Log file command line option description contains an extra word has been fixed by [MNG-5891][MNG-5891]

* org.apache.maven.repository.internal.RemoteSnapshotMetadataTest fails to start at midnight fixed with
  [MNG-5907][MNG-5907].

* Multi-module build with ear fails to resolve war in 3.3.3 fixed in [MNG-5898][MNG-5898].

Task
----

* Update [Modello site url](https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/modello/) [MNG-5887][MNG-5887].
