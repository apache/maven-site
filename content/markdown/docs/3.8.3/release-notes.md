# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.8.3

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.8.3.

Maven 3.8.3 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.8.3/](/ref/3.8.3/)

## Overview About the Changes

* Regression fixes from Maven 3.8.2
