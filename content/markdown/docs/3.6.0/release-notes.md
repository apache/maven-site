# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.6.0

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.6.0

Maven 3.6.0 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [https://maven.apache.org/][2]
- the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.0/](/ref/3.6.0/)

## Known Issues

At the time of release, there are no known regressions introduced by this release.

## Overview about the changes

- There had been issues related to the project discoverytime which has
  been increased in previous version which influenced some of our users.
  This should have been fixed [MNG-6311], [MNG-6383] and [MNG-6412].

- The output in the reactor summary has been improved [MNG-6391]
  cause it confused people. In Maven 3.6.0 the reactor summary now
  looks like the following:

```
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Reactor Summary for parent 5.0.4-SNAPSHOT:
[INFO]
[INFO] parent ............................................. SUCCESS [  1.559 s]
[INFO] domain ............................................. SUCCESS [  1.238 s]
[INFO] service-client ..................................... SUCCESS [  0.108 s]
[INFO] webgui ............................................. SUCCESS [  0.652 s]
[INFO] service ............................................ SUCCESS [  0.379 s]
[INFO] app ................................................ SUCCESS [  0.304 s]
[INFO] appasm ............................................. SUCCESS [  0.265 s]
[INFO] shade .............................................. SUCCESS [  0.440 s]
[INFO] assembly ........................................... SUCCESS [  1.531 s]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  6.824 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2018-11-01T12:20:16+01:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The `parent` in the above output is the artifact name of the root module and
the `5.0.4-SNAPSHOT` is the versions number for all modules in this
reactor build.

If you have an aggregator pom which contains different modules with different
versions each line will contain the appropriate versions which looks like this:

```
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Reactor Summary:
[INFO]
[INFO] Apache Maven ACR Plugin 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT ............. SUCCESS [  0.221 s]
[INFO] Apache Maven AntRun Plugin 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT .......... SUCCESS [  0.004 s]
