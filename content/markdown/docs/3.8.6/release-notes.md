# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.8.6

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.8.6.

Maven 3.8.6 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList][1] for more information.
