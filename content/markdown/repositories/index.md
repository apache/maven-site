Apache Maven uses repositories to store artifacts. Your dependencies are being downloaded from repositories,
and artifacts you build are being stored (installed, uploaded) into repositories as well. This is one of the
fundamental concepts of Maven since its inception: Maven command line tool and Maven Repositories were mold together
and developed since the beginning of Maven project itself.

As you may know, Maven addresses artifacts using artifact coordinates. The artifact coordinates uniquely describe the artifact
you are referring to, but does not tell anything about its source (or origin). This is where
Maven Repositories come into picture, that holds the artifacts laid out (published) according to Maven Repository
Layout. And this is where the circle closes: artifacts, being laid out in defined layout, consumed and published
by Maven.
