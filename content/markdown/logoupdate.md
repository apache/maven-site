# Updating Maven logo

In September 2025 the ASF [announced a new logo for the foundation](https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/introducing-the-asfs-new-logo) the "[oak leaf](https://apache.org/images/oakleaf.svg)" as a replacement for the long year known feather.

As a result, the Maven project needs to update its logo. 
This page lists all affected logos, which need recreated by a professional.

 Number | Format |                              Icon                               |                                                    Source File                                                    |

*Note*: For 1 and 4 no SVG is available.

As you can see, two images need small additional changes aside replacing the feather with the oak leaf:

* Logo #1: This also needs an update from "http" to "https"
* Logo #4: This should be updated so the text “Maven” matches the other logos: Crossed feathers/leafs as the "v" and no highlighted "a" or feather/leaf on top of it.
