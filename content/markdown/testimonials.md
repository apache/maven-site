Keep on going with Maven 2.0 as it really rocks! Yesterday, I started
experimenting with it and it's such a breeze, I'm becoming already
productive with Maven, converting our hand-written Ant scripts to POM
(which means throwing most of the Ant stuff away and replacing it with
tiny pom.xml files, actually). We have a web application consisting of
many components which need to be configured for different environments
and customers. After one day of work (including the learning curve) I
already have the complete code base with \>1000 java files in \~20
modules compiling.

An hour ago or so after I finally got the Castor stuff working I began
to see just how marvellous Maven works with my multi-module project.
Seems you guys are able to keep the promises you make in the Maven
introduction. :-)

Once again, thanks for creating this great tool!
