# Installation

Apache Maven can be installed by most package managers, 
or manually by downloading the archive and adding it to your path.

#[[##]]# Prerequisites

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Either set the `JAVA_HOME` 
environment variable to the path of your JDK installation or have the `java` executable
on your `PATH`.

The current stable version `${currentStableVersion}` requires JDK 8+, but any recent version will work just fine. 

#[[##]]# Binary distribution

To install Apache Maven, extract the archive and add its bin directory to the `PATH`.
This works on any operating system, but setting the path and environment variables depends on the OS.

Detailed steps are:

1. Download the Apache Maven [binary distribution archive](/download.html). 

2. Extract the distribution archive in any directory. Use `unzip apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}-bin.zip`
or `tar xzvf apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}-bin.tar.gz` depending on the archive.

3. Add the `bin` directory of the created directory `apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}` to 
the `PATH` environment variable

4. Confirm with `mvn -v` in a new shell. The result should look similar to:

```
Apache Maven ${currentStableVersion} (${currentStableVersionDetails})
Maven home: /opt/apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}
Java version: 1.8.0_45, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.8.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

Thatâ€™s it! Maven is now installed.
