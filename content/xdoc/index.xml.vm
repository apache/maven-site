    <section name="Welcome to Apache Maven">
      <p>
        Apache Maven is a build tool for Java projects. Using a project object model
        (POM), Maven manages a project's compilation, testing, and documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find more information in the "About Maven"
        section of the sidebar. This includes an in-depth description of <a href="what-is-maven.html">what Maven is</a> and a list of some of its main features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: this could be the big button type thing instead of a list of links -->
        This site is separated into the following sections:

      <p>
        Each guide is divided into a number of trails to get you started on a particular topic, and includes a
        reference area and a "cookbook" of common examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access the guides at any time from the left navigation.
        If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the <a href="guides/index.html">documentation index</a>.

      <h3>How to Get Support</h3>
      <p>
        Support for Maven is available in a variety of different forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, search the documentation,
        <a href="issue-management.html">issue management system</a>, the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN">wiki</a>,
        or the <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing list archives</a> to
        see if the problem has been solved or reported before.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the problem has not been reported before, the recommended way to get help is to
        subscribe to the <a href="mailing-lists.html">Maven Users Mailing list</a>. Many other users and Maven developers
        will answer your questions there, and the answer will be archived for others in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also reach the Maven developers on <a href="community.html">Slack</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Apache Software Foundation</h3>
      <p>
        Maven is a part of the Apache Software Foundation. We'd like to <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html">thank
        the sponsors</a> that provide financial assistance to the foundation. For more information on how you can support the
        foundation, see the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html">sponsorship</a> page.

        </a>
        You can also attend <a href="https://www.apache.org/events/current-event.html">Apache Events</a>. Ask on the <a href="mailing-lists.html">Maven User mailing list</a>
        if Maven team members will be there. It can be a great opportunity to meet them.
