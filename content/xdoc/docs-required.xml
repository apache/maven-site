        - multi module howto
        - per user scm setup
          - outline behaviour when connection and developConnection are defined

           Our current URL looks like:
           scm:cvs:pserver:@cvs.host.name:/cvsroot:module-version

           Using this URL, the default is to connect to the CVS server using the
           same userid as the current user.  This is the desired behavior and I
           don't want to mess that up.  I just would like a means to add a userid
           in the URL only in special circumstances like Continuum.

           We might want to do something where we say it is a best practice to
           specify a ${user} and take it from the environment and allow an override.

        - testing a plugin
        - How to get started behind an NTLM proxy.
        - How snapshots works
        - How do i use the lifecycle provided by a plugin:
        - How do i disable ibiblio
        - using version ranges
        - plugin expressions (look at bob allison's work)
        - overriding the central repository (use central)
        - description of what packagings are available and how they work
        - creating upload bundles
        - modello example
        - changing the snapshot policy frequency
        - overriding central repo
        - using POM info in applications: the POM is packaged so there is acccess
          continuum example to get the version.
        - quick description of scm,wagon,continuum

      <h4>Profiles Example</h4>
      <pre><![CDATA[
it's possible to do it with m2 beta-1 and profiles.

you declare profile in your pom like this:

   <profiles>
     <profile>
       <id>env-test</id>
       <activation>
         <property>
           <name>env</name>
           <value>test</value>
         </property>
       </activation>
       <properties>
         <appProperties>test.properties</appProperties>
       </properties>
     </profile>
     <profile>
       <id>env-production</id>
       <activation>
         <property>
           <name>env</name>
           <value>production</value>
         </property>
       </activation>
       <properties>
         <appProperties>app.properties</appProperties>
       </properties>
     </profile>
   </profiles>

and you can run mvn with one of profiles like:
mvn -P env-production clean:clean install ==> we use the profile id
or
mvn -Denv=test clean:clean install ==> we use the property env define in
<activation>
