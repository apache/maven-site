* 2.2.0 Release Notes

  Maven 2.2.0 contains a few important changes that justify the version upgrade, instead of simply naming it 2.1.1. First, the Java requirement for Maven 2.2.0 has been upgraded to 1.5 or later. This upgrade was planned for 2.1.0, but that release still contained binaries that were compatible with JDK 1.4. In addition, due to some serious flaws in the version-expression POM transformation included in 2.1.0, this feature has been removed for the time being. Finally, some new default execution IDs have been added to Maven to enable the separation of configuration for plugins bound by the default lifecycle mappings, and for those invoked directly from the command line. All of these issues have been described below with their associated JIRA tickets.

  The full list of changes can be found in our {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10500&styleName=Html&version=15103}issue management system}}, and is reproduced below.

** Changes that may affect existing builds

    * MNG-4143 - Starting in 2.2.0, Maven will run only on Java 1.5 and later. You can still build projects for JDK1.4 and earlier using the approach documented in the  {{{./guides/mini/guide-building-jdk14-on-jdk15.html}Guide to Building JDK 1.4 Projects on JDK 1.5}}.

    * MNG-3401 - Executions with an id equal to <<<default->>><phase> (where <phase> is a valid lifecycle phase) may have unexpected results as it will be merged into the default lifecycle.

    * MNG-4140/4179 - Version-expression resolution during installation and deployment has been removed, returning to Maven 2.0.x behaviour.

** Noteworthy changes and improvements

    * MNG-3401 - Starting in Maven 2.2.0, goals invoked directly from the command line can be configured in the POM separately from other plugin invocations using a special executionId called <<<default-cli>>>. Where previously, all configurations for command-line goals had to go in the plugin-level configuration, Maven 2.2.0 allows command-line-specific configurations to be separated into their own <<<\<execution\>>>>. For more information, see the {{{./guides/mini/guide-default-execution-ids.html}Guide to Default Execution IDs}}.
    
    * MNG-3203 - Similar to MNG-3401, previous to Maven 2.2.0 it was impossible to separate configurations for different goals from a single plugin that were bound to the lifecycle by the default mappings for a given packaging. Beginning in Maven 2.2.0, it is possible to separate configurations for <<<compiler:compile>>> from those for <<<compiler:testCompile>>> using executions with IDs <<<default-compile>>> and <<<default-testCompile>>> respectively. In the case of the compiler plugin, this allows the separation of include and exclude patterns that are applied during the two compiler activities in the <<<jar>>> build. For more information, see the {{{./guides/mini/guide-default-execution-ids.html}Guide to Default Execution IDs}}.
    
    * MNG-4179 - <<Regression:>> In Maven 2.1.0, artifact downloads hang when a transfer failure occurred. This has been corrected.
  
    * MNG-4184 - <<Regression:>> Maven 2.1.0 failed with a cyclic dependency in cases where a dependency for a report plugin is build as part of the current reactor. This has been corrected.
  
    * MNG-4167 - <<Regression:>> Version-expression resolution for POMs in Maven 2.1.0 took place as a transformation phase during artifact installation and deployment. However, this caused the deployed POM to be different from the one signed by the GPG plugin. Because of this and other use-case problems, version-expression resolution has been removed from Maven 2.2.0 pending a more comprehensive design review. MNG-4223 provides tracking for this review.

    * MNG-4140 - <<Regression:>> Version-expression resolution for POMs in Maven 2.1.0 was too aggressive, replacing not only version expressions in artifact coordinates, but also in plugin configurations and POM properties. As mentioned above, version-expression resolution has been removed pending further review.
